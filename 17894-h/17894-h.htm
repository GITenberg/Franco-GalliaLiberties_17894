<p><i>The following Translation of the Famous</i> Hotoman's
Franco-Gallia <i>was written in the Year 1705, and first publish'd
in the Year 1711. The Author was then at a great Distance from</i>
London, <i>and the Publisher of his Work, for Reasons needless to
repeat, did not think fit to print the Prefatory Discourse sent
along with the Original. But this Piece being seasonable at all
Times for the Perusal of</i> Englishmen <i>and more particularly at
this Time, I wou'd no longer keep back from the Publick, what I
more than conjecture will be acceptable to all true Lovers of their
Country.</i></p>

<h4>THE</h4>

<h3>TRANSLATOR's</h3>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Many Books and Papers have been publish'd since the late
<i>Revolution</i>, tending to justify the Proceedings of the People
of <i>England</i> at that happy juncture; by setting in a true
Light our just Rights and Liberties, together with the solid
Foundations of our <i>Constitution:</i> Which, in truth, is not
ours only, but that of almost all <i>Europe</i> besides; so wisely
restor'd and establish'd (if not introduced) by the <i>Goths</i>
and <i>Franks</i>, whose Descendants we are.</p>

<p>These Books have as constantly had some things, called
<i>Answers</i>, written to them, by Persons of different
Sentiments; who certainly either never seriously consider'd, that
the were thereby endeavouring to destroy their own Happiness, and
overthrow her Majesty's Title to the Crown: or (if they knew what
they did) presumed upon the <i>Lenity</i> of that Government they
decry'd; which (were there no better Reason) ought to have
recommended it to their Approbation, since it could patiently bear
with such, as were doing all they could to undermine it.</p>

<p>Not to mention the Railing, Virulency, or personal false
Reflections in many of those Answers, (which were always the Signs
of a weak Cause, or a feeble Champion) some of them asserted the
<i>Divine Right</i> of an <i>Hereditary Monarch</i>, and the
Impiety of <i>Resistance</i> upon any Terms whatever,
notwithstanding any <i>Authorities</i> to the contrary.</p>

<p>Others (and those the more judicious) deny'd positively, that
sufficient <i>Authorities</i> could be produced to prove, that a
<i>free People</i> have a <i>just Power</i> to defend themselves,
by opposing their <i>Prince</i>, who endeavours to oppress and
enslave them: And alledged, that whatever was said or done tending
that way, proceeded from a Spirit of <i>Rebellion</i>, and
<i>Antimonarchical Principles</i>.</p>

<p>To confute, or convince this last Sort of Arguers (the first not
being worthy to have Notice taken of them) I set about translating
the <i>Franco-Gallia</i> of that most Learned and Judicious
<i>Civilian</i>, <i>Francis Hotoman</i>; a Grave, Sincere and
Unexceptionable Author, even in the Opinion of his Adversaries.
This Book gives an Account of the Ancient Free State of above Three
Parts in Four of <i>Europe</i>; and has of a long time appeared to
me so convincing and instructive in those important Points he
handles, that I could not be idle whilst it remain'd unknown, in a
manner, to <i>Englishmen</i>: who, of all People living, have the
greatest Reason and Need to be thoroughly instructed in what it
contains; as having, on the one hand, the most to lose, and on the
other, the least Sense of their Right, to that, which hitherto they
seem (at least in a great measure) to have preserv'd.</p>

<p>It will be obvious to every Reader, that I have taken no great
Pains to write elegantly. What I endeavour at, is as plain a Stile
as possible, which on this Occasion I take to be the best: For
since the Instruction of Mankind ought to be the principal Drift of
all Writers (of History especially); whoever writes to the Capacity
of most Readers, in my Opinion most fully answers the End.</p>

<p>I am not ignorant, how tiresome and difficult a Piece of Work it
is to translate, nor how little valued in the World. My Experience
has convinced me, that 'tis more troublesome and teazing than to
write and invent at once. The Idiom of the Language out of which
one translates, runs so in the Head, that 'tis next to impossible
not to fall frequently into it. And the more bald and incorrect the
Stile of the Original is, the more shall that of the Translation be
so too. Many of the Quotations in this Book are drawn from Priests,
Monks, Friars, and Civil Lawyers, who minded more, in those
barbarous Ages, the Substance than the Stile of their Writings: And
I hope those Considerations may atone for several Faults, which
might be found in my Share of this Work.</p>

<p>But I desire not to be misunderstood, as if (whilst I am craving
Favour for my self) I were making any Apology for such a Number of
mercenary Scribblers, Animadverters, and Translators, as pester us
in this Age; who generally spoil the good Books which fall into
their Hands, and hinder others from obliging the Publick, who
otherwise would do it to greater Advantage.</p>

<p>I take this Author to be one of those few, that has had the good
Luck to escape them; and I make use of this Occasion to declare,
that the chief Motive which induces me to send abroad this small
Treatise, is a sincere desire of instructing the only Possessors of
true Liberty in the World, what Right and Title that have to that
Liberty; of what a great Value it is; what Misery follows the Loss
of it; how easily, if Care be taken in time, it may be preserv'd:
And if this either opens the Eyes, or confirms the honourable
Resolutions of any of my worthy Countrymen, I have gained a
glorious End; and done that in my Study, which I shou'd have
promoted any other way, had I been called to it. I hope to die with
the Comfort of believing, that <i>Old England</i> will continue to
be a free Country, and <i>know</i> itself to be <i>such</i>; that
my Friends, Relations and Children, with their Posterity, will
inherit their Share of this inestimable Blessing, and that I have
contributed my Part to it.</p>

<p>But there is one very great Discouragement under which both I,
and all other Writers and Translators of Books tending to the
acquiring or preserving the publick Liberty, do lie; and that is,
the heavy Calumny thrown upon us, that we are all
<i>Commonwealth's-Men</i>: Which (in the ordinary Meaning of the
Word) amounts to <i>Haters</i> of <i>Kingly</i> Government; now
without broad, malicious Insinuations, that we are no great Friends
of the present.</p>

<p>Indeed were the <i>Laity</i> of our Nation (as too many of our
<i>Clergy</i> unhappily are) to be guided by the Sense of one of
our Universities, solemnly and publickly declared by the burning of
Twenty seven Propositions (some of them deserving that Censure, but
others being the very Foundation of all our Civil Rights;) I, and
many like me, would appear to be very much in the wrong. But since
the <i>Revolution</i> in Eighty-eight, that we stand upon another
and a better Bottom, tho no other than our own old one, 'tis time
that our <i>Notions</i> should be suited to our
<i>Constitution</i>. And truly, as Matters stand, I have often
wondred, either how so many of our Gentlemen, educated under such
Prejudices, shou'd retain any Sense at all of Liberty, for <i>the
hardest Lesson is to unlearn</i>; [Footnote: St. Chrysostom.] or how
an Education so diametrically opposite to our Bill of Rights,
shou'd be so long encouraged.</p>

<p>Methinks a <i>Civil Test</i> might be contrived, and prove very
convenient to distinguish those that own the <i>Revolution
Principles</i>, from such as Tooth and Nail oppose them; and at the
same time do fatally propagate Doctrines, which lay too heavy a
Load upon <i>Christianity</i> it self, and make us prove our own
Executioners.</p>

<p>The Names of <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i> will, I am afraid, last
as long among us, as those of <i>Guelf</i> and <i>Ghibelline</i>
did in <i>Italy</i>. I am sorry for it: but to some they become
necessary for Distinction Sake; not so much for the Principles
formerly adapted to each Name, as for particular and worse Reasons.
For there has been such chopping and changing both of Names and
Principles, that we scarce know who is who. I think it therefore
necessary, in order to appear in my own Colours, to make a publick
Profession of my <i>Political Faith</i>; not doubting but it may
agree in several Particulars with that of many worthy Persons, who
are as undeservedly aspers'd as I am.</p>

<p>My Notion of a <i>Whig</i>, I mean of a real <i>Whig</i> (for
the Nominal are worse than any Sort of Men) is, That he is one who
is exactly for keeping up to the Strictness of the true old
<i>Gothick Constitution</i>, under the <i>Three Estates</i> of
<i>King</i> (or <i>Queen</i>) <i>Lords</i> and <i>Commons</i>; the
<i>Legislature</i> being seated in all Three together, the
<i>Executive</i> entrusted with the first, but accountable to the
whole Body of the People, in Case of Male Administration.</p>

<p>A true <i>Whig</i> is of Opinion, that the Executive Power has
as just a Title to the <i>Allegiance</i> and Obedience of the
Subject, according to the <i>Rules of known Laws enacted by the
Legislative</i>, as the <i>Subject</i> has to <i>Protection,
Liberty</i> and <i>Property</i>: And so on the contrary.</p>

<p>A true <i>Whig</i> is not afraid of the Name of a
<i>Commonwealthsman</i>, because so many foolish People, who know
not what it means, run it down: The <i>Anarchy</i> and
<i>Confusion</i> which these Nations fell into near Sixty Years
ago, and which was <i>falsly</i> called a <i>Commonwealth</i>,
frightning them out of the true Construction of the Word. But Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>, and many other of our best Princes, were not
scrupulous of calling our Government a <i>Commonwealth</i>, even in
their solemn Speeches to <i>Parliament</i>. And indeed if it be not
one, I cannot tell by what Name properly to call it: For where in
the very <i>Frame</i> of the <i>Constitution</i>, the Good of the
<i>Whole</i> is taken care of by the <i>Whole</i> (as 'tis in our
Case) the having a <i>King</i> or <i>Queen</i> at the Head of it,
alters not the Case; and the softning of it by calling it a
<i>Limited Monarchy</i>, seems a Kind of Contradiction in Terms,
invented to please some weak and doubting Persons.</p>

<p>And because some of our <i>Princes</i> in this last Age, did
their utmost Endeavour to destroy this Union and Harmony of the
<i>Three Estates</i>, and to be <i>arbitrary</i> or <i>independent,
they</i> ought to be looked upon as the <i>Aggressors</i> upon our
Constitution.</p>

<p>This drove the other <i>Two Estates</i> (for the Sake of the
publick Preservation) into the fatal Necessity of providing for
themselves; and when once the Wheel was set a running, 'twas not in
the Power of Man to stop it just where it ought to have stopp'd.
This is so ordinary in all violent Motions, whether mechanick or
political, that no body can wonder at it.</p>

<p>But no wise Men approved of the ill Effects of those violent
Motions either way, cou'd they have help'd them. Yet it must be
owned they have (as often as used, thro an extraordinary Piece of
good Fortune) brought us back to our old Constitution again, which
else had been lost; for there are numberless Instances in History
of a Downfal from a State of <i>Liberty</i> to a <i>Tyranny</i>,
but very few of a Recovery of <i>Liberty</i> from <i>Tyranny</i>,
if this last have had any Length of Time to fix it self and take
Root.</p>

<p>Let all such, who either thro Interest or Ignorance are Adorers
of <i>absolute Monarchs</i>, say what they please; an <i>English
Whig</i> can never be so unjust to his Country, and to right
Reason, as not to be of Opinion, that in all Civil Commotions,
which Side soever is the <i>wrongful Aggressor</i>, is accountable
for all the evil Consequences: And thro the Course of his reading
(tho my Lord <i>Clarendon's</i> Books be thrown into the Heap) he
finds it very difficult to observe, that ever the People of
<i>England</i> took up Arms against their <i>Prince</i>, but when
constrain'd to it by a necessary Care of their <i>Liberties</i> and
true <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis certainly as much a <i>Treason</i> and <i>Rebellion</i>
against this <i>Constitution</i>, and the <i>known</i> Laws, in a
<i>Prince</i> to endeavor to break thro them, as 'tis in the
<i>People</i> to rise against him, whilst he keeps within their
Bounds, and does his Duty. Our Constitution is a Government of
<i>Laws</i>, not of <i>Persons. Allegiance</i> and
<i>Protection</i> are Obligations that cannot subsist separately;
when one fails, the other falls of Course. The true Etymology of
the word <i>Loyalty</i> (which has been so strangely wrested in the
late Reigns) is an entire Obedience to the Prince in all his
Commands according to Law; that is, to the <i>Laws themselves</i>,
to which we owe both an active and passive Obedience.</p>

<p>By the old and true Maxim, that <i>the King can do no Wrong</i>,
nobody is so foolish as to conclude, that he has not Strength to
murder, to offer Violence to Women, or Power enough to dispossess a
Man wrongfully of his Estate, or that whatever he does (how wicked
soever) is just: but the Meaning is, he has no <i>lawful Power</i>
to do such Things; and our Constitution considers no <i>Power</i>
as <i>irresistible</i>, but what is <i>lawful</i>.</p>

<p>And since <i>Religion</i> is become a great and universal
Concern, and drawn into our Government, as it affects every single
Man's Conscience; tho my private Opinion, they ought not to be
mingled, nor to have any thing to do with each other; (I do not
speak of our Church Polity, which is a Part of our State, and
dependent upon it) some account must be given of that Matter.</p>

<p><i>Whiggism</i> is not circumscrib'd and confin'd to any one or
two of the <i>Religions</i> now profess'd in the World, but
diffuses it self among all. We have known <i>Jews, Turks</i>, nay,
some Papists, (which I own to be a great Rarity) very great Lovers
of the Constitution and Liberty; and were there rational Grounds to
expect, that any Numbers of them cou'd be so, I shou'd be against
using Severities and Distinctions upon Account of Religion. For a
Papist is not dangerous, nor ought to be ill us'd by any body,
because he prays to Saints, believes Purgatory, or the real
Presence in the Eucharist, and pays Divine Worship to an Image or
Picture (which are the common Topicks of our Writers of Controversy
against the Papists;) but because Popery sets up a <i>foreign
Jurisdiction paramount to our Laws</i>. So that a <i>real
Papist</i> can neither be a true <i>Governor</i> of a
<i>Protestant</i> Country, nor a true <i>Subject</i>, and besides,
is the most <i>Priest-Ridden</i> Creature in the World: and (when
uppermost) can bear with no body that differs from him in Opinion;
little considering, that whosoever is against <i>Liberty of
Mind</i>, is, in effect, against <i>Liberty of Body</i> too. And
therefore all Penal <i>Acts</i> of <i>Parliament</i> for Opinions
<i>purely</i> religious, which have no Influence on the
<i>State</i>, are so many Encroachments upon <i>Liberty</i>, whilst
those which restrain Vice and Injustice are against
<i>Licentiousness</i>.</p>

<p>I profess my self to have always been a Member of the
<i>Church</i> of <i>England</i> and am for supporting it in all its
<i>Honours</i>, <i>Privileges</i> and <i>Revenues</i>: but as a
Christian and a <i>Whig</i>, I must have Charity for those that
differ from me in <i>religious</i> Opinions, whether <i>Pagans</i>,
<i>Turks</i>, <i>Jews</i>, <i>Papists</i>, <i>Quakers</i>,
<i>Socinians</i>, <i>Presbyterians</i>, or others. I look upon
<i>Bigotry</i> to have always been the very Bane of human Society,
and the Offspring of Interest and Ignorance, which has occasion'd
most of the great Mischiefs that have afflicted Mankind. We ought
no more to expect to be all of one Opinion, as to the Worship of
the <i>Deity</i>, than to be all of one Colour or Stature. To
stretch or narrow any Man's Conscience to the Standard of our own,
is no less a Piece of Cruelty than that of <i>Procrustes</i> the
Tyrant of <i>Attica</i>, who used to fit his Guests to the Length
of his own Iron Bedsted, either by cutting them shorter, or racking
them longer. What just Reason can I have to be angry with, to
endeavour to curb the natural Liberty, or to retrench the Civil
Advantages of an honest Man (who follows the golden Rule, of
<i>doing to others, as he wou'd have others do to him</i>, and is
willing and able to serve the Publick) only because he thinks his
Way to Heaven surer or shorter than mine? No body can tell which of
us is mistaken, till the Day of Judgment, or whether any of us be
so (for there may be different Ways to the same End, and I am not
for circumscribing God Almighty's Mercy:) This I am sure of, one
shall meet with the same Positiveness in Opinion, in some of the
Priests of all these Sects; The same Want of Charity, engrossing
Heaven by way of <i>Monopoly</i> to their own <i>Corporation</i>,
and managing it by a joint Stock, exclusive of all others (as
pernicious in Divinity as in trade, and perhaps more) The same
Pretences to <i>Miracles, Martyrs, Inspirations, Merits,
Mortifications, Revelations, Austerity, Antiquity</i>, &amp;c. (as
all Persons conversant with History, or that travel, know to be
true) and this <i>cui bono</i>? I think it the Honour of the
Reformed Part of the Christian Profession, and the Church of
<i>England</i> in particular, that it pretends to fewer of these
unusual and extraordinary Things, than any other Religion we know
of in the World; being convinced, that these are not the
distinguishing Marks of the Truth of any Religion (I mean, the
assuming obstinate Pretences to them are not;) and it were not
amiss, if we farther enlarg'd our Charity, when we can do it with
Safety, or Advantage to the State.</p>

<p>Let us but consider, how hard and how impolitick it is to
condemn all People, but such as think of the Divinity just as we
do. May not the Tables of Persecution be turn'd upon us? A
<i>Mahometan</i> in <i>Turky</i> is in the right, and I (if I carry
my own Religion thither) am in the Wrong. They will have it so. If
the <i>Mahometan</i> comes with me to <i>Christendom</i>, I am in
the right, and he in the wrong; and hate each other heartily for
differing in Speculations, which ought to have no Influence on
Moral Honesty. Nay, the <i>Mahometan</i> is the more charitable of
the two, and does not push his Zeal so far; for the Christians have
been more cruel and severe in this Point than all the World
besides. Surely Reprizals may be made upon us; as <i>Calvin</i>
burnt <i>Servetus</i> at <i>Geneva</i>, Queen <i>Mary</i> burnt
<i>Cranmer</i> at <i>London</i>. I am sorry I cannot readily find a
more exact Parallel. The Sword cuts with both Edges. Why, I pray
you, may we not all be Fellow-Citizens of the World? And provided
it be not the Principle of one or more Religions to extirpate all
others, and to turn Persecutors when they get Power (for such are
not to be endured;) I say, why shou'd we offer to hinder any Man
from doing with his own Soul what he thinks fitting? Why shou'd we
not make use of his Body, Estate, and Understanding, for the
publick Good? Let a Man's Life, Substance, and Liberty be under the
Protection of the Laws; and I dare answer for him (whilst his Stake
is among us) he will never be in a different Interest, nor willing
to quit this Protection, or to exchange it for <i>Poverty,
Slavery</i>, and <i>Misery</i>.</p>

<p>The thriving of any one <i>single Person</i> by honest Means, is
the Thriving of the <i>Commonwealth</i> wherein he resides. And in
what Place soever of the World such Encouragement is given, as that
in it one may securely and peaceably enjoy <i>Property</i> and
<i>Liberty</i> both of <i>Mind</i> and <i>Body</i>; 'tis impossible
but that Place must flourish in <i>Riches</i> and in <i>People</i>,
which are the <i>truest Riches</i> of any Country.</p>

<p>But as, on the one hand, a true <i>Whig</i> thinks that all
Opinions purely spiritual and notional ought to be indulg'd; so on
the other, he is for <i>severely punishing</i> all <i>Immoralities,
Breach</i> of <i>Laws, Violence</i> and <i>Injustice</i>. A
Minister's Tythes are as much his Right, as any Layman's Estate can
be his; and no Pretence of Religion or Conscience can warrant the
substracting of them, whilst the Law is in Being which makes them
payable: For a <i>Whig</i> is far from the Opinion, that they are
due by any other Title. It wou'd make a Man's Ears tingle, to hear
the <i>Divine Right</i> insisted upon for any <i>human
Institutions</i>; and to find God <i>Almighty</i> brought in as a
Principal there, where there is no Necessity for it. To affirm,
that <i>Monarchy, Episcopacy, Synods, Tythes</i>, the <i>Hereditary
Succession</i> to the <i>Crown</i>, &amp;c. are <i>Jure Divino</i>;
is to cram them down a Man's Throat; and tell him in plain Terms,
that he must submit to any of them under all Inconveniencies,
whether the Laws of his Country are for it or against it. Every
<i>Whig</i> owns <i>Submission</i> to Government to be an
<i>Ordinance</i> of God. <i>Submit your selves to every Ordinance
of Man, for the Lord's Sake</i>, says the Apostle. Where (by the
way) pray take notice, he calls them <i>Ordinances of Man</i>; and
gives you the true Notion, how far any thing can be said to be
<i>Jure Divino</i>: which is far short of what your high-flown
Assertors of the <i>Jus Divinum</i> wou'd carry it, and proves as
strongly for a <i>Republican</i> Government as a
<i>Monarchical</i>; tho' in truth it affects neither, where the
very Ends of Government are destroyed.</p>

<p>A right <i>Whig</i> looks upon <i>frequent Parliaments</i> as
such a <i>fundamental</i> Part of the Constitution, that even no
<i>Parliament</i> can part with this Right. <i>High Whiggism</i> is
for <i>Annual</i> Parliaments, and <i>Low Whiggism</i> for
<i>Triennial</i>, with annual Meetings. I leave it to every Man's
Judgment, which of these wou'd be the truest Representative; wou'd
soonest ease the House of that Number of Members that have Offices
and Employments, or take Pensions from the Court; is least liable
to Corruption; wou'd prevent exorbitant Expence, and soonest
destroy the pernicious Practice of drinking and bribing for
Elections, or is most conformable to ancient Custom. The Law that
lately pass'd with so much Struggle for <i>Triennial</i>
Parliaments shall content me, till the <i>Legislative</i> shall
think fit to make them <i>Annual</i>.</p>

<p>But methinks (and this I write with great Submission and
Deference) that (since the passing that Act) it seems inconsistent
with the Reason of the thing, and preposterous, for the
<i>first</i> Parliament after any Prince's <i>Accession</i> to the
<i>Crown</i>, to give the publick Revenue <i>arising by Taxes</i>,
for a longer time than that <i>Parliament's own Duration</i>. I
cannot see why the Members of the <i>first</i> Parliament shou'd
(as the Case now stands) engross to themselves all the Power of
giving, as well as all the Merit and Rewards due to such a Gift:
and why <i>succeeding</i> Parliaments shou'd not, in their turn,
have it in their Power to oblige the Prince, or to streighten him,
if they saw Occasion; and pare his Nails, if they were convinced he
made <i>ill Use</i> of such a <i>Revenue</i>. I am sure we have had
Instances of this Kind; and a wise Body of Senators ought always to
provide against the worst that might happen. The <i>Honey-Moon</i>
of <i>Government</i> is a dangerous Season; the Rights and
Liberties of the People run a greater Risk at that time, thro their
own Representatives Compliments and Compliances, than they are ever
likely to do during that Reign: and 'tis safer to break this
Practice, when we have the Prospect of a good and gracious Prince
upon the Throne, than when we have an inflexible Person, who thinks
every Offer an Affront, which comes not up to the Height of what
his Predecessor had, without considering whether it were well or
ill done at first.</p>

<p>The Revenues of our Kings, for many Ages, arose out of their
<i>Crown-Lands</i>; Taxes on the Subject were raised only for
publick Exigencies. But since we have turn'd the Stream, and been
so free of Revenues for Life, arising from <i>Impositions</i> and
<i>Taxes</i>, we have given Occasion to our Princes to dispose of
their <i>Crown-Lands</i>; and depend for Maintenance of their
Families on such a Sort of Income, as is thought unjust and ungodly
in most Parts of the World, but in <i>Christendom</i>: for many of
the arbitrary <i>Eastern</i> Monarchs think so, and will not eat
the Produce of such a Revenue. Now since Matters are brought to
this pass, 'tis plain that our Princes must subsist suitable to
their high State and Condition, in the best manner we are able to
provide for them. And whilst the <i>Calling</i> and <i>Duration</i>
of Parliaments was <i>precarious</i>, it might indeed be an <i>Act
of Imprudence</i>, tho not of <i>Injustice</i>, for any <i>one
Parliament</i> to settle such a Sort of <i>Revenue</i> for Life on
the Prince: But at present, when all the World knows the <i>utmost
Extent</i> of a Parliament's <i>possible</i> Duration, it seems
disagreeable to Reason, and an Encroachment upon the Right of
<i>succeeding</i> Parliaments (for the future) for any <i>one
Parliament</i> to do that which <i>another</i> cannot undo, or has
not Power to do in its turn.</p>

<p>An Old <i>Whig</i> is for chusing such Sort of
<i>Representatives</i> to serve in Parliament, as have
<i>Estates</i> in the Kingdom; and those not fleeting ones, which
may be sent beyond Sea by Bills of Exchange by every Pacquet-Boat,
but fix'd and permanent. To which end, every Merchant, Banker, or
other money'd Man, who is ambitious of serving his Country as a
<i>Senator</i>, shou'd have also a competent, visible <i>Land
Estate</i>, as a Pledge to his <i>Electors</i> that he intends to
abide by them, and has the same Interest with theirs in the publick
Taxes, Gains and Losses. I have heard and weigh'd the Arguments of
those who, in Opposition to this, urged the Unfitness of such,
whose Lands were engaged in Debts and Mortgages, to serve in
Parliament, in comparison with the <i>mony'd Man</i> who had no
<i>Land:</i> But those Arguments never convinced me.</p>

<p>No Man can be a sincere Lover of Liberty, that is not for
increasing and communicating that Blessing to all People; and
therefore the giving or restoring it not only to our Brethren of
<i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, but even to <i>France</i> it
self (were it in our Power) is one of the principal Articles of
<i>Whiggism</i>. The Ease and Advantage which wou'd be gain'd by
<i>uniting</i> our own Three Kingdoms upon equal Terms (for upon
unequal it wou'd be no <i>Union</i>) is so visible, that if we had
not the Example of those Masters of the World, the <i>Romans</i>,
before our Eyes, one wou'd wonder that our own Experience (in the
Instance of uniting <i>Wales</i> to <i>England</i>) shou'd not
convince us, that altho both Sides wou'd incredibly gain by it, yet
the rich and opulent Country, to which such an Addition is made,
wou'd be the greater Gainer. 'Tis so much more desirable and
<i>secure</i> to govern by <i>Love</i> and <i>common Interest</i>,
than by <i>Force</i>; to expect <i>Comfort</i> and
<i>Assistance</i>, in Times of Danger, from our next Neighbours,
than to find them at such a time a <i>heavy Clog</i> upon the
Wheels of our Government, and be in dread lest they should take
that Occasion to shake off an uneasy Yoak: or to have as much need
of entertaining a <i>standing</i> Army against our <i>Brethren</i>,
as against our known and inveterate <i>Enemies</i>; that certainly
whoever can oppose so publick and apparent Good, must be esteem'd
either <i>ignorant</i> to a strange Degree, or to have <i>other</i>
Designs in View, which he wou'd willingly have brought to
Light.</p>

<p>I look upon her Majesty's asserting the Liberties and Privileges
of the <i>Free Cities</i> in <i>Germany</i>, an Action which will
shine in History as bright (at least) as her giving away her first
Fruits and Tenths: To the Merit of which last, some have assumingly
enough ascribed all the Successes she has hitherto been blessed
with; as if <i>one Set of Men</i> were the <i>peculiar</i> Care of
Providence and all others (even <i>Kings</i> and <i>Princes</i>)
were no otherwise fit to be considered by <i>God Almighty</i>, or
Posterity, than according to their <i>Kindness</i> to them. But it
has been generally represented so, where Priests are the
Historians. From the first Kings in the World down to these Days,
many Instances might be given of very wicked Princes, who have been
extravagantly commended; and many excellent ones, whose Memories
lie overwhelmed with Loads of Curses and Calumny, just as they
proved Favourers or Discountenancers of High-Church, without regard
to their other Virtues or Vices: for High-Church is to be found in
all Religions and Sects, from the Pagan down to the Presbyterian;
and is equally detrimental in every one of them.</p>

<p>A Genuine <i>Whig</i> is for promoting a <i>general
Naturalization</i>, upon the firm Belief, that whoever comes to be
incorporated into us, feels his Share of all our Advantages and
Disadvantages, and consequently can have no Interest but that of
the Publick; to which he will always be a Support to the best of
his Power, by his <i>Person, Substance</i> and <i>Advice</i>. And
if it be a Truth (which few will make a Doubt of) that we are not
one <i>third</i> Part peopled (though we are better so in
Proportion than any other Part of <i>Europe, Holland</i> excepted)
and that our Stock of Men decreases daily thro our Wars,
Plantations, and Sea-Voyages; that the ordinary Course of
Propagation (even in Times of continued Peace and Health) cou'd not
in many Ages supply us with the Numbers we want; that the Security
of Civil and Religious Liberty, and of Property, which thro God's
great Mercy is firmly establish'd among us, will invite new Comers
as fast as we can entertain them; that most of the rest of the
World groans under the Weight of <i>Tyranny</i>, which will cause
all that have Substance, and a Sense of Honour and Liberty, to fly
to Places of Shelter; which consequently would thoroughly people us
with useful and profitable Hands in a few Years. What should hinder
us from an Act of <i>General Naturalization</i>? Especially when we
consider, that no <i>private</i> Acts of that Kind are refused; but
the Expence is so great, that few attempt to procure them, and the
Benefit which the Publick receives thereby is inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Experience has shown us the Folly and Falsity of those plausible
Insinuations, that such a Naturalization would take the Bread out
of <i>Englishmen's</i> Mouths. We are convinced, that the greater
Number of Workmen of one Trade there is in any Town, the more does
that Town thrive; the greater will be the <i>Demand</i> of the
Manufacture, and the <i>Vent</i> to foreign Parts, and the quicker
<i>Circulation</i> of the <i>Coin</i>. The Consumption of the
<i>Produce</i> both of <i>Land</i> and <i>Industry</i> increases
visibly in Towns full of People; nay, the more shall every
particular industrious Person thrive in such a Place; tho indeed
<i>Drones</i> and <i>Idlers</i> will not find their Account, who
wou'd fain support their own and their Families superfluous
Expences at their Neighbour's Cost; who make one or two Day's
Labour provide for four Days Extravagancies. And this is the common
Calamity of most of our <i>Corporation Towns</i>, whose Inhabitants
do all they can to discourage Plenty, Industry and Population; and
will not admit of Strangers but upon too hard Terms, thro the false
Notion, that they themselves, their Children and Apprentices, have
the only Right to squander their Town's Revenue, and to get, at
their own Rates, all that is to be gotten within their Precincts,
or in the Neighbourhood. And therefore such Towns (through the
Mischief arising by <i>Combinations</i> and <i>By-Laws</i>) are at
best at a Stand; very few in a thriving Condition (and those are
where the <i>By-Laws</i> are least <i>restrictive</i>) but
<i>most</i> throughout <i>England</i> fall to visible Decay, whilst
new Villages <i>not</i> incorporated, or more liberal of their
Privileges, grow up in their stead; till, in Process of Time, the
first Sort will become almost as desolate as <i>Old Sarum</i>, and
will as well deserve to lose their Right of sending Representatives
to Parliament. For certainly a <i>Waste</i> or a <i>Desert</i> has
no Right to be represented, nor by our original Constitution was
ever intended to be: yet I would by no means have those Deputies
lost to the Commons, but transferr'd to wiser, more industrious,
and better peopled Places, worthy (thro their Numbers and Wealth)
of being represented.</p>

<p>A <i>Whig</i> is against the raising or keeping up a <i>Standing
Army</i> in Time of Peace: but with this Distinction, that if at
any time an <i>Army</i> (tho even in Time of Peace) shou'd be
necessary to the Support of this very Maxim, a <i>Whig</i> is not
for being too hasty to destroy that which is to be the Defender of
his Liberty. I desire to be well understood. Suppose then, that
Persons, whose known Principle and Practice it has been (during the
Attempts for arbitrary Government) to plead for and promote such an
Army in Time of Peace, as wou'd be subservient to the Will of a
Tyrant, and contribute towards the enslaving the Nation; shou'd,
under a <i>legal Government</i> (yet before the <i>Ferment</i> of
the People was appeas'd) cry down a <i>Standing Army</i> in Time of
Peace: I shou'd shrewdly suspect, that the Principles of such
Persons are not changed, but that either they like not the Hands
that <i>Army</i> is in, or the <i>Cause</i> which it espouses; and
look upon it as an Obstruction to <i>another</i> Sort of Army,
which they shou'd like <i>even in Time of Peace</i>. I say then,
that altho the Maxim in general be certainly <i>true</i>, yet a
<i>Whig</i> (without the just Imputation of having deserted his
Principles) may be for the <i>keeping</i> up such a Standing Army
even in Time of Peace, till the Nation have recover'd its
<i>Wits</i> again, and chuses Representatives who are against
<i>Tyranny in any Hands whatsoever</i>; till the Enemies of our
Liberties want the Power of raising <i>another</i> Army of <i>quite
different Sentiments</i>: for till that time, a <i>Whiggish</i>
Army is the <i>Guardian of our Liberties</i>, and secures to us the
Power of <i>disbanding its self</i>, and prevents the raising of
another of a <i>different Kidney</i>. As soon as this is done
effectually, by my Consent, no such thing as a mercenary Soldier
should subsist in <i>England</i>. And therefore The <i>arming</i>
and <i>training</i> of all the <i>Freeholders</i> of
<i>England</i>, as it is our undoubted ancient Constitution, and
consequently our Right; so it is the Opinion of most <i>Whigs</i>,
that it ought to be put in Practice. This wou'd put us out of all
Fear of foreign Invasions, or disappoint any such when attempted:
This wou'd soon take away the Necessity of maintaining
<i>Standing</i> Armies of <i>Mercenaries</i> in Time of Peace: This
wou'd render us a hundred times more formidable to our Neighbours
than we are; and secure effectually our Liberties against any
<i>King</i> that shou'd have a mind to invade them at home, which
perhaps was the Reason some of our late <i>Kings</i> were so averse
to it: And whereas, as the Case now stands, Ten Thousand
disciplin'd Soldiers (once landed) might march without
<i>considerable</i> Opposition from one End of <i>England</i> to
the other; were our <i>Militia</i> well regulated, and
<i>Fire-Arms</i> substituted in the Place of <i>Bills, Bows</i>,
and <i>Arrows</i> (the Weapons in Use when our <i>training Laws</i>
were in their Vigor, and for which our Laws are yet in Force) we
need not fear a Hundred Thousand Enemies, were it possible to land
so many among us. At every Mile's End, at every River and Pass, the
Enemy wou'd meet with fresh Armies, consisting of Men as well
skill'd in military Discipline as themselves; and more resolv'd to
fight, because they do it for Property: And the farther such an
Enemy advanced into the Country, the stronger and more resolved he
wou'd find us; as <i>Hanibal</i> did the <i>Romans</i>, when he
encamped under the Walls of <i>Rome</i>, even after such a Defeat
as that at <i>Cann&aelig;</i>. And why? Because they were all
<i>train'd</i> Soldiers, they were all <i>Freemen</i> that fought
<i>pro aris &amp; focis</i>: and scorn'd to trust the Preservation
of their Lives and Fortunes to <i>Mercenaries</i> or <i>Slaves</i>,
tho never so able-body'd: They thought Weapons became not the Hands
of such as had nothing to lose, and upon that Account were unfit
Defenders of their Masters Properties; so that they never tried the
Experiment but in the <i>utmost Extremity</i>.</p>

<p>That this is not only practicable but easy, the modern Examples
of the <i>Swissers</i> and <i>Swedes</i> is an undeniable
Indication. <i>Englishmen</i> have as much <i>Courage</i>, as great
<i>Strength of Body</i>, and <i>Capacity of Mind</i>, as any People
in the Universe: And if our late <i>Monarchs</i> had the
<i>enervating</i> their free Subjects in View, that they might give
a Reputation to <i>Mercenaries</i>, who depended only on the
<i>Prince</i> for their Pay (as 'tis plain they had) I know no
Reason why their Example shou'd be followed in the Days of
<i>Liberty</i>, when there is no such Prospect. The Preservation of
the <i>Game</i> is but a very slender Pretence for omitting it. I
hope no wise Man will put a <i>Hare</i> or a <i>Partridge</i> in
Balance with the <i>Safety</i> and <i>Liberties</i> of
<i>Englishmen</i>; tho after all, 'tis well known to Sportsmen,
that Dogs, Snares, Nets, and such silent Methods as are daily put
in Practice, destroy the Game ten times more than shooting with
Guns.</p>

<p>If the restoring us to our Old Constitution in this Instance
were ever necessary, 'tis more eminently so at this time, when our
next Neighbours of <i>Scotland</i> are by Law armed just in the
manner we desire to be, and the <i>Union</i> between both Kingdoms
not perfected. For the <i>Militia</i>, upon the Foot it now stands,
will be of little Use to us: 'tis generally compos'd of Servants,
and those not always the same, consequently not well train'd;
rather such as wink with both Eyes at their own firing a Musket,
and scarce know how to keep it clean, or to charge it aright. It
consists of People whose Reputation (especially the <i>Officers</i>)
has been industriously diminished, and their Persons, as well as
their Employment, rendred contemptible on purpose to enhance the
Value of those that serve for Pay; insomuch that few Gentlemen of
Quality will now a-days debase themselves so much, as to accept of
a Company, or a Regiment in the <i>Militia</i>. But for all this, I
can never be persuaded that a <i>Red Coat</i>, and <i>Three Pence</i> a
Day, infuses more Courage into the poor <i>Swaggering
Idler</i>, than the having a Wife and Children, and an Estate to
fight for, with good wholsome Fare in his Kitchen, wou'd into a
<i>Free-born</i> Subject, provided the <i>Freeman</i> were as well
armed and trained as the <i>Mercenary</i>.</p>

<p>I wou'd not have the <i>Officers</i> and <i>Soldiers</i> of our
most Brave and Honest <i>Army</i> to mistake me. I am not arguing
against them; for I am convinced, as long as there is Work to do
abroad, 'tis they (and not our home dwelling <i>Freeholders</i>)
are most proper for it. Our War must now be an <i>Offensive</i>
War; and what I am pleading for, concerns only the bare
<i>Defensive</i> Part. Most of our present Generals and Officers
are fill'd with the true Sprit of Liberty (a most rare thing) which
demonstrates the Felicity of her Majesty's Reign, and her standing
upon a true Bottom, beyond any other Instance that can be given;
insomuch, that considering how great and happy we have been under
the Government of <i>Queens</i>, I have sometimes doubted, whether
an <i>Anti-Salick Law</i> wou'd be to our Disadvantage.</p>

<p>Most of these <i>Officers</i> do expect, nay (so true do I take
them to be to their Country's Interest) do wish, whenever it shall
please God to send us such a Peace as may be relied upon both at
home and abroad, to return to the State of <i>peaceable
Citizens</i> again; but 'tis fit they should do so, with such ample
Rewards for their Blood and Labours, as shall entirely satisfy
them. And when they, or the Survivors of them, shall return full of
Honour and Scars home to their Relations, after the Fatigues of so
glorious a Service to their Country are ended; 'tis their Country's
Duty to make them easy, without laying a Necessity upon them of
striving for the Continuance of an <i>Army</i> to avoid
<i>starving</i>. The <i>Romans</i> used to content them by a
Distribution of their Enemies Lands; and I think their Example so
good in every thing, that we could hardly propose a better.
<i>Oliver Cromwell</i> did the like in <i>Ireland</i>, to which we
owe that Kingdom's being a Protestant Kingdom at this Day, and its
continuing subject to the Crown of <i>England</i>; but if it be too
late to think of this Method now, some other must be found out by
the Wisdom of <i>Parliament</i>, which shall fully answer the
End.</p>

<p>These Officers and Soldiers thus settled and reduced to a
<i>Civil State</i>, wou'd, in a great measure, compose that
invincible <i>Militia</i> I am now forecasting; and by reason of
their Skill in military Affairs, wou'd deserve the principal Posts
and Commands in their respective Counties: With this advantageous
Change of their Condition, that whereas formerly they fought for
their Country only as <i>Soldiers</i> of <i>Fortune</i>, now they
shou'd defend it as wise and valiant <i>Citizens</i>, as
<i>Proprietors</i> of the Estates they fight for; and this will
gain them the entire Trust and Confidence of all the good People of
<i>England</i>, who, whenever they come to know their own Minds, do
heartily hate <i>Slavery</i>. The Manner and Times of assembling,
with several other necessary Regulations, are only proper for the
<i>Legislative</i> to fix and determine.</p>

<p>A right <i>Whig</i> lays no Stress upon the <i>Illegitimacy</i>
of the <i>pretended Prince</i> of <i>Wales</i>; he goes upon
another Principle than they, who carry the <i>Right of
Succession</i> so far, as (upon that Score), to undo all Mankind.
He thinks no Prince fit to govern, whose Principle it must be to
<i>ruin</i> the Constitution, as soon as he can acquire unjust
Power to do so. He judges it Nonsense for one to be the <i>Head of
a Church</i>, or <i>Defender of a Faith</i>, who thinks himself
bound in Duty to overthrow it. He never endeavours to justify his
taking the Oaths to this Government, or to quiet his Conscience, by
supposing the young <i>Gentleman</i> at <i>St. Germains</i>
unlawfully begotten; since, 'tis certain, that according to our Law
he cannot be looked upon as such. He cannot satisfy himself with
any of the foolish Distinctions trump'd up of late Years to
reconcile base Interest with a Show of Religion; but deals upon the
Square, and plainly owns to the World, that he is not influenc'd by
any particular Spleen: but that the Exercise of an <i>Arbitrary,
Illegal Power</i> in the Nation, so as to undermine the
Constitution, wou'd incapacitate either King <i>James</i>, King
<i>William</i>, or any other, from being his <i>King</i>, whenever
the <i>Publick</i> has a Power to hinder it.</p>

<p>As a necessary Consequence of this Opinion, a <i>Whig</i> must
be against <i>punishing the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the
Children</i>, as we do (not only to the <i>Third</i> and <i>Fourth
Generation</i>, but) <i>for ever</i>: since our gracious God has
declared, that he will no more pursue such severe Methods in his
Justice, but that <i>the Soul that sinneth it shall die</i>. 'Tis
very unreasonable, that frail Man, who has so often need of Mercy,
shou'd pretend to exercise higher Severities upon his
<i>Fellow-Creatures</i>, than that Fountain of Justice on his most
wicked <i>revolting Slaves</i>. To corrupt the Blood of a whole
<i>Family</i>, and send <i>all</i> the Offspring a begging after
the Father's Head is taken off, seems a strange Piece of Severity,
fit to be redressed in Parliament; especially when we come to
consider, for what Crime this has been commonly done. When Subjects
take Arms against their <i>Prince</i>, if their Attempt succeeds,
'tis a <i>Revolution</i>; if not, 'tis call'd a <i>Rebellion</i>:
'tis seldom consider'd, whether the first Motives be just or
unjust. Now is it not enough, in such Cases, for the prevailing
Party to hang or behead the <i>Offenders</i>, if they can catch
them, without extending the Punishment to <i>innocent Persons</i>
for <i>all Generations</i> to come?</p>

<p>The Sense of this made the late <i>Bill of Treasons</i> (tho it
reach'd not so far as many wou'd have had it) a Favourite of the
<i>Old Whigs</i>; they thought it a very desirable one whenever it
cou'd be compass'd, and perhaps if not at that very Juncture, wou'd
not have been obtained all: 'twas necessary for Two different Sorts
of People to unite in this, in order for a Majority, whose Weight
shou'd be sufficient to enforce it. And I think some <i>Whigs</i>
were very unjustly reproach'd by their <i>Brethren</i>, as if by
voting for this Bill, they wilfully exposed the late <i>King's</i>
Person to the wicked Designs of his Enemies.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, The supporting of Parliamentary Credit, promoting
of all <i>publick Buildings</i> and <i>Highways</i>, the making all
<i>Rivers Navigable</i> that are capable of it, employing the
<i>Poor</i>, suppressing <i>Idlers</i>, restraining
<i>Monopolies</i> upon Trade, maintaining the liberty of the
<i>Press</i>, the just <i>paying</i> and <i>encouraging</i> of all
in the publick Service, especially that best and usefullest Sort of
People the <i>Seamen</i>: These (joined to a firm Opinion, that we
ought not to hearken to any <i>Terms of Peace</i> with the
<i>French King</i>, till it be quite out of his Power to hurt us,
but rather to dye in Defence of our <i>own</i> and the
<i>Liberties</i> of <i>Europe</i>) are all of them Articles of my
<i>Whiggish Belief</i>, and I hope none of them are
<i>heterodox</i>. And if all these together amount to a
<i>Commonwealthsman</i>, I shall never be asham'd of the Name, tho
given with a Design of fixing a Reproach upon me, and such as think
as I do.</p>

<p>Many People complain of the Poverty of the Nation, and the
Weight of the Taxes. Some do this without any ill Design, but
others hope thereby to become <i>popular</i>; and at the same time
to <i>enforce a Peace</i> with <i>France</i>, before that Kingdom
be reduced to too low a Pitch: fearing, lest that <i>King</i>
shou'd be <i>disabled</i> to accomplish their Scheme of bringing in
the <i>Pretender</i>, and assisting him.</p>

<p>Now altho 'tis acknowledg'd, that the <i>Taxes</i> lye very
heavy, and <i>Money</i> grows scarce; yet let the <i>Importance</i>
of our <i>War</i> be considered, together with the <i>Obstinacy,
Perfidy</i>, and <i>Strength</i> of our Enemy, can we possibly
carry on such a <i>diffusive</i> War without <i>Money</i> in
Proportion? Are the <i>Queen's</i> Subjects more burden'd to
maintain the publick <i>Liberty</i>, than the <i>French</i> King's
are to confirm their own <i>Slavery</i>? Not so much by three Parts
in four, God be prais'd: Besides, no true <i>Englishman</i> will
grudge to pay Taxes whilst he has a Penny in his Purse, as long as
he sees the Publick Money well laid out for the great Ends for
which 'tis given. And to the Honour of the Queen and her Ministers
it may be justly said, That since <i>England</i> was a Nation,
never was the publick Money more frugally managed, or more fitly
apply'd. This is a further Mortification to those <i>Gentlemen</i>,
who have <i>Designs</i> in View which they dare not own: For
whatever may be, the <i>plausible</i> and <i>specious</i> Reasons
they give in publick, when they exclaim against the Ministry; the
hidden and true one is, that thro the present prudent
Administration, their so hopefully-laid Project is in Danger of
being blown quite up; and they begin to despair that they shall
bring in King <i>James</i> the Third by the Means of Queen
<i>Anne</i>, as I verily believe they once had the Vanity to
imagine.</p>

<h1>LIFE</h1>

<h4>OF</h4>

<h2><i>Francis Hotoman</i>,</h2>

<h4>Taken out of Monsieur <i>Bayle's</i></h4>

<h4>Hist. Dict. and other Authors.</h4>

<p><i>FRANCIS HOTOMAN</i> (one of the most learned Lawyers of that Age) was
Born at <i>Paris</i> the 23d of <i>August</i>, 1524. His Family was an Ancient and
Noble one, originally of <i>Breslaw</i>, the Capital of <i>Silesia</i>. <i>Lambert
Hotoman</i>, his Grandfather, bore Arms in the Service of <i>Lewis</i> the 11th
of <i>France</i>, and married a rich Heiress at <i>Paris</i>, by whom he had 18
Children; the Eldest of which (<i>John Hotoman</i>) had so plentiful an
Estate, that he laid down the Ransom-Money for King <i>Francis</i> the First,
taken at the Battel of <i>Pavia</i>: <i>Summo galli&aelig; bono, summ&acirc;
cum su&acirc; laude</i>, says <i>Neveletus</i>, <i>Peter Hotoman</i> his 18th Child,
and [Footnote: <i>Maistre des Eaux &amp; Forrests.</i>] <i>Master of the Waters and
Forests</i> of <i>France</i> (afterwards a Counsellor in the Parliament of
<i>Paris</i>) was Father to <i>Francis</i>, the <i>Author</i> of this Book. He sent his
Son, at 15 Years of Age, to <i>Orleans</i> to study the <i>Common Law</i>; which
he did with so great Applause, that at Three Years End he merited the
Degree of Doctor. His Father designing to surrender to him his Place of
Counsellor of <i>Parliament</i>, sent for him home: But the young Gentleman
was soon tired with the Chicane of the Bar, and plung'd himself deep in
the Studies of [Footnote: <i>Les belles Lettres.</i>] <i>Humanity</i> and the <i>Roman
Laws</i>; for which he had a wonderful Inclination. He happen'd to be a
frequent Spectator of the Protestants Sufferings, who, about that Time,
had their Tongues cut out, were otherwise tormented, and burnt for their
Religion. This made him curious to dive into those Opinions, which
inspired so much Constancy, Resignation and Contempt of Death; which
brought him by degrees to a liking of them, so that he turn'd
Protestant. And this put him in Disgrace with his father, who thereupon
disinherited him; which forced him at last to quit <i>France</i>, and to
retire to <i>Lausanne</i> in <i>Swisserland</i> by <i>Calvin</i>'s and <i>Beza</i>'s Advice;
where his great Merit and Piety promoted him to the Humanity-Professor's
Chair, which he accepted of for a Livelihood, having no Subsistance from
his Father. There he married a young <i>French</i> Lady, who had fled her
Country upon the Score of Religion: He afterwards remov'd to
<i>Strasburg</i>, where he also had a Professor's Chair. The Fame of his
great Worth was so blown about, that he was invited by all the great
Princes to their several Countries, particularly by the <i>Landgrave</i> of
<i>Hesse</i>, the <i>Duke</i> of <i>Prussia</i>, and the <i>King</i> of <i>Navarre</i>; and he
actually went to this last about the Beginning of the Troubles. Twice he
was sent as Ambassador from the Princes of the Blood of <i>France</i>, and
the Queen-Mother, to demand Assistance of the Emperor <i>Ferdinand:</i> The
Speech that he made at the Diet of <i>Francfort</i> is still extant.
Afterwards he returned to <i>Strasburg</i>; but <i>Jean de Monluc</i>, the Bishop
of <i>Valence</i>, over-persuaded him to accept of the Professorship of Civil
Law at <i>Valence</i>; of which he acquitted himself so well, that he very
much heighten'd the Reputation of that University. Here he received two
Invitations from <i>Margaret</i> Dutchess of <i>Berry</i>, and Sister to <i>Henry</i>
the Second of <i>France</i>, and accepted a Professor's Chair at <i>Bourges</i>;
but continued in it no longer than five Months, by reason of the
intervening Troubles. Afterwards he returned to it, and was there at the
time of the great <i>Parisian</i> Massacre, having much-a-do to escape with
his Life; but having once got out of <i>France</i> (with a firm Resolution
never to return thither again) he took Sanctuary in the House of
<i>Calvin</i> at <i>Geneva</i>, and publish'd Books against the Persecution, so
full of Spirit and good Reasoning, that the Heads of the contrary Party
made him great Offers in case he wou'd forbear Writing against them; but
he refused them all, and said, The Truth shou'd never be betray'd or
forsaken by him. <i>Neveletus</i> says, "That his Reply to those that wou'd
have tempted him, was this: <i>Nunquam sibi propugnatam causam qu&aelig;
iniqua esset: Nunquam qu&aelig; jure &amp; legibus niteretur desertam
pr&aelig;miorum spe vel metu periculi</i>."&mdash;He afterwards went to
<i>Basel</i> in <i>Swisserland</i>, and from thence (being driven away by the
Plague) to <i>Mountbelliard</i>, where he buried his Wife. He returned then
to <i>Basel</i> (after having refused a Professor's Chair at <i>Leyden</i>) and
there he died of a Dropsy in the 65th Year of his Age, the 12th of
<i>February</i>, 1590.</p>

<p>He writ a great many learned Books, which were all of them in
great Esteem; and among them an excellent Book <i>de
Consolatione</i>. His <i>Francogallia</i> was his own Favourite;
tho' blamed by several others, who were of the contrary Opinion:
Yet even these who wrote against him do unanimously agree, that he
had a World of Learning, and a profound Erudition. He had a
thorough Knowledge of the Civil Law, which he managed with all the
Eloquence imaginable; and was, without dispute, one of the ablest
Civilians that <i>France</i> had ever produced: This is <i>Thuanus</i> and
<i>Barthius</i>'s Testimony of him. Mr. <i>Bayle</i> indeed passes
his Censure of this Work in the Text of his Dictionary, in these
Words: "<i>Sa Francogallia dont il faisoit grand etat est celuy de
tous ses ecrits que l'on aprouve le moins:</i>"&mdash;and in his
Commentary adds, "<i>C'est un Ouvrage recommendable du cost&egrave;
de l'Erudition; mais tres indigne d'un jurisconsulte Francois, si
l'on en croit mesme plusieurs Protestants</i>." I wou'd not do any
Injury to so great a Man as Monsieur <i>Bayle</i>; but every one
that is acquainted with his Character, knows that he is more a
Friend to Tyranny and Tyrants, than seems to be consistent with so
free a Spirit. He has been extremely ill used, which sowres him to
such a degree, that it even perverts his Judgment in some measure;
and he seems resolved to be against Monsieur <i>Jurieu</i>, and
that Party, in every thing, right or wrong. Whoever reads his
Works, may trace throughout all Parts of them this Disposition of
Mind, and see what sticks most at his Heart. So that he not only
loses no Occasion, but often forces one where it seems improper and
unseasonable, to vent his Resentments upon his Enemies; who surely
did themselves a great deal more wrong in making him so, than they
did him. 'Tis too true, that they did all they cou'd to starve him;
and this great Man was forced to write in haste for Bread; which
has been the Cause that some of his Works are shorter than he
design'd them; and consequently, that the World is deprived of so
much Benefit, as otherwise it might have reap'd from his prodigious
Learning, and Force of Judgment. One may see by the first Volume of
his Dictionary, which goes through but two Letters of the Alphabet,
that he forecasted to make that Work three times as large as it is,
cou'd he have waited for the Printer's Money so long as was
requisite to the finishing it according to his first Design. Thus
much I thought fit to say, in order to abate the Edge of what he
seems to speak hardly of the <i>Francogallia</i>; tho' in several
other Places he makes my Author amends: And one may without scruple
believe him, when he commends a Man, whose Opinion he condemns. For
this is the Character he gives of this Work: <i>"C'est au fond un
bel Ouvrage, bien ecrit, &amp; bien rempli d'erudition: Et d'autant
plus incommode au partie contraire que l'Auteur se contente de
citer des faits."</i> Can any thing in the World be a greater
Commendation of a Work of this Nature, than to say it contains only
pure Matter of Fact? Now if this be so, Monsieur <i>Bayle</i> wou'd
do well to tell us what he means by those Words, <i>Tres indigne
d'un jurisconsulte Francois</i>. Whether a <i>French</i> Civilian
be debarr'd telling of Truth (when that Truth exposes Tyranny) more
than a Civilian of any other Nation? This agrees, in some measure,
with Monsieur <i>Teissier</i>'s Judgment of the
<i>Francogallia</i>, and shews, that Monsieur <i>Bayle</i>, and
Monsieur <i>Teissier</i> and <i>Bongars</i>, were <i>Bons
Francois</i> in one and the same Sense. "<i>Son Livre
intitul&egrave;, Francogallia, luy attira AVEC RAISON</i> (and this
he puts in great Letters) <i>les blame des bons Francois</i>. For
(says he) therein he endeavours to prove, That <i>France</i>, the
most flourishing Kingdom in <i>Christendom</i>, is not successive,
like the Estates of particular Persons; but that anciently the
Kings came to the Crown by the Choice and Suffrages of the Nobility
and People; insomuch, that as in former Times the Power and
Authority of <i>Electing</i> their Kings belonged to the <i>Estates
of the Kingdom</i>, so likewise did the Right of <i>Deposing</i>
their <i>Princes</i> from their Government. And hereupon he quotes
the Examples of <i>Philip de Valois</i>, of <i>King John</i>,
<i>Charles the Fifth</i>, and <i>Charles the Sixth</i>, and
<i>Lewis the Eleventh</i>: But what he principally insists on, is
to show, That as from Times Immemorial, the <i>French</i> judg'd
Women incapable of Governing; So likewise ought they to be debarr'd
from all Administration of the Publick Affairs."</p>

<p>This is Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s Quotation of <i>Teissier</i>, by
which it appears how far <i>Hotoman</i> ought to be blamed by all
<i>true Frenchmen, AVEC RAISON</i>. But provided that
<i>Hotoman</i> proves irrefragably all that he says (as not only
Monsieur <i>Bayle</i> himself, but every body else that writes of
him allows) I think it will be a hard matter to persuade a
disinteress'd Person, or any other but a <i>bon Francois</i>,
(which, in good <i>English</i>, is a <i>Lover of his Chains</i>)
that here is any just Reason shewn why <i>Hotoman</i> shou'd be
blam'd.</p>

<p>Monsieur <i>Teissier</i>, altho' very much prejudiced against
him, was (as one may see by the Tenor of the above Quotation, and
his leaving it thus uncommented on) in his Heart convinc'd of the
Truth of it; but no <i>bon Francois</i> dares own so much. He was a
little too careless when he wrote against <i>Hotoman</i>, mistaking
one of his Books for another; <i>viz</i>. his Commentary <i>ad
titulum institutionum de Actionibus</i>, for his little Book <i>de
gradibus cognationis</i>; both extremely esteemed by all learned
Men, especially the first: Of which Monsieur <i>Bayle</i> gives
this Testimony: "<i>La beaut&eacute; du Stile, &amp; la
connoissance des antiquit&eacute;s Romaines eclatoient dans cet
Ouvrage, &amp; le firent fort estimer</i>."</p>

<p><i>Thuanus</i>, that celebrated disinteress'd Historian, gives
this Character in general of his Writings. "He composed (says he)
several Works very profitable towards the explaining of the Civil
Law, Antiquity, and all Sorts of fine Literature; which have been
collected and publish'd by <i>James Lectius</i>, a famous Lawyer,
after they had been review'd and corrected by the Author.
<i>Barthius</i> says, that he excelled in the Knowledge of the
Civil Law, and of all genteel Learning [Footnote: <i>Belles
Literature</i>] <i>Ceux la mesmes qui ont ecrits contre luy</i>
(says <i>Neveletus</i>) <i>tombent d'accord quil avoit beaucoup de
lecture &amp; une profonde Erudition</i>."</p>

<p>The Author of the <i>Monitoriale adversus Italogalliam</i>,
which some take to be <i>Hotoman</i> himself, has this Passage
relating to the <i>Francogallia</i>: "Quomodo potest aliquis et
succcensere qui est tantum relator &amp; narrator facti?
<i>Francogallista</i> enim tantum narrationi &amp; relationi
simplici vacat, quod si aliena dicta delerentur, charta remaneret
alba."</p>

<p>It was objected to him, that he unawares furnish'd the Duke of
<i>Guise</i> and the <i>League</i> at <i>Paris</i> with Arguments
to make good their Attempts against their Kings. This cannot be
deny'd; but at the same time it cannot be imputed to <i>Hotoman</i>
as any Crime: Texts of Scripture themselves have been made use of
for different Purposes, according to the Passion or the Interests
of Parties. Arguments do not lose their native Force for being
wrong apply'd: If the Three <i>Estates of France</i> had such a
fundamental Power lodg'd in them; who can help it, if the Writers
for the <i>League</i> made use of Hotoman's Arguments to support a
wrong Cause? And this may suffice to remove this Imputation from
his Memory.</p>

<p>He was a Man of a very handsome Person and Shape, tall and
comely; his Eyes were blewish, his Nose long, and his Countenance
venerable: He joined a most exemplary Piety and Probity to an
eminent Degree of Knowledge and Learning. No Day pass'd over his
Head, wherein he employ'd not several Hours in the Exercise of
Prayer, and reading of the Scriptures. He wou'd never permit his
Picture to be drawn, tho' much intreated by his Friends; however
(when he was at his last Gasp, and cou'd not hinder it) they got a
Painter to his Bed's-side, who took his Likeness as well as 'twas
possible at such a time. <i>Basilius Amerbachius</i> assisted him
during his last Sickness, and <i>James Grin&aelig;us</i> made his
Funeral-Sermon. He left two Sons behind him, <i>John</i> and
<i>Daniel</i>; besides a great Reputation, and Desire of him, not
only among his Friends and Acquaintance, but all the Men of
Learning and Probity all over <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<h3><i>The Author's Preface.</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/051a.jpg" alt=
"Ornament" /></div>

<p class="one">To the most Illustrious and Potent Prince <i>FREDERICK</i>,
Count Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, Duke of <i>Bavaria</i>, &amp;c.
First Elector of the <i>Roman</i> Empire, His most Gracious Lord,
<i>Francis Hotoman</i>, wishes all Health and Prosperity.</p>

<p><i>'Tis an old Saying, of which</i> Teucer <i>the Son of</i>
Telamon <i>is the supposed Author, and which has been approved of
these many Ages</i>, A Man's Country is, where-ever he lives at
Ease. [Footnote: <i>Patria est ubicunq; est bene.</i>] <i>For to
bear even Banishment it self with an unconcern'd Temper of Mind
like other Misfortunes and Inconveniences, and to despise the
Injuries of an ungrateful Country, which uses one more like a
Stepmother than a true Mother, seems to be the Indication of a
great Soul. But I am of a quite different Opinion: For if it be a
great Crime, and almost an Impiety not to live under and suffer
patiently the Humours and harsh Usage of our Natural Parents; 'tis
sure a much greater, not to endure those of our Country, which wise
Men have unanimously preferr'd to their</i> Parents. <i>'Tis indeed
the Property of a wary self-interested Man, to measure his Kindness
for his Country by his own particular Advantages: But such a sort
of Carelesness and Indifferency seems a Part of that Barbarity
which was attributed to the</i> Cynicks <i>and</i> Epicureans;
<i>whence that detestable Saying proceeded</i>, When I am dead, let
the whole World be a Fire. <i>Which is not unlike the Old
Tyrannical Axiom</i>; Let my Friends perish, so my Enemies fall
along with them. [Footnote: <i>Me mortuo terra misceatur incendio.
Pereant amici dum una inimici intercidant.</i>] <i>But in gentle
Dispositions, there is a certain inbred Love of their Country,
which they can no more divest themselves of, than of Humanity it
self. Such a Love as</i> Homer <i>describes in</i> Ulysses, <i>who
preferred</i> Ithaca, <i>tho' no better than a Bird's Nest fix'd to
a craggy Rock in the Sea, to all the Delights of the Kingdom
which</i> Calypso <i>offer'd him</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Was very truly said by the Ancient Poet; When we think of
that Air we first suck'd in, that Earth we first trod on, those
Relations, Neighbours and Acquaintance to whose Conversation we
have been accustomed</i>.</p>

<p><i>But a Man may sometimes say, My</i> Country <i>is grown</i>
mad <i>or</i> foolish, <i>(as</i> Plato <i>said of his) sometimes
that it rages and cruelly tears out its own Bowels.&mdash;We are to
take care in the first Place, that we do not ascribe</i> other
Folks <i>Faults to our innocent</i> Country. <i>There have been may
cruel</i> Tyrants <i>in</i> Rome <i>and in other Places; these not
only tormented innocent good Men, but even the best deserving
Citizens, with all manner of Severities: Does it therefore follow,
that the Madness of these Tyrants must be imputed to their Country?
The Cruelty of the Emperor</i> Macrinus <i>is particularly
memorable; who as</i> Julius Capitolinus <i>writes, was
nicknamed</i> Macellinus, <i>because his House was stained with the
Blood of Men, as a Shambles is with that of Beasts. Many such
others are mention'd by Historians, who for the like Cruelty (as
the same</i> Capitolinus <i>tells us) were stil'd, one</i> Cyclops,
<i>another</i> Busiris, <i>a 3d</i> Sciron, <i>a 4th</i> Tryphon,
<i>a 5th</i> Gyges. <i>These were firmly persuaded, that Kingdoms
and Empires cou'd not be secur'd without Cruelty: Wou'd it be
therefore reasonable, that good Patriots shou'd lay aside all Care
and Solicitude for their Country? Certainly they ought rather to
succour her, when like a miserable oppressed Mother, she implores
her Childrens Help, and to seek all proper Remedies for the
Mischiefs that afflict her.</i></p>

<p><i>But how fortunate are those Countries that have good and mild
Princes! how happy are those Subjects, who, thro' the Benignity of
their Rulers may quietly grow old on their Paternal Seats, in the
sweet Society of their Wives and Children! For very often it
happens, that the Remedies which are made use of prove worse than
the Evils themselves. 'Tis now, most Illustrious Prince, about
Sixteen Years since God Almighty has committed to your Rule and
Government a considerable Part of</i> Germany <i>situate on the</i>
Rhine. <i>During which time, 'tis scarce conceivable what a general
Tranquility, what a Calm (as in a smooth Sea) has reigned in the
whole</i> Palatinate; <i>how peaceable and quiet all things have
continued: How piously and religiously they have been governed: Go
on most Gracious Prince in the same Meekness of Spirit, which I to
the utmost of my Power must always extol. Proceed in the same
Course of gentle and peaceable Virtue</i>; Macte Virtute; <i>not in
the Sense which</i> Seneca <i>tells us the</i> Romans <i>used this
Exclamation in, to salute their Generals when they return'd all
stain'd with Gore Blood from the Field of Battel, who were rather
true</i> Macellinus's: <i>But do you proceed in that Moderation of
Mind, Clemency, Piety, Justice, Affability, which have occasion'd
the Tranquility of your Territories. And because the present
Condition of your</i> Germany <i>is such as we see it, Men
now-a-days run away from Countries infested with Plunderers and
Oppressors, to take Sanctuary in those that are quiet and
peaceable; as Mariners, who undertake a Voyage, forecast to avoid
Streights, &amp;c. and Rocky Seas, and chase to sail a calm and
open Course</i>.</p>

<p><i>There was indeed a Time, when young Gentlemen, desirous of
Improvement, flock'd from all Parts to the Schools and Academies of
our</i> Francogallia, <i>as to the publick Marts of good
Literature. Now they dread them as Men do Seas infested with
Pyrates, and detest their Tyrannous Barbarity. The Remembrance of
this wounds me to the very Soul; when I consider my unfortunate
miserable Country has been for almost twelve Years, burning in the
Flames of Civil War. But much more am I griev'd, when I reflect
that so many have not only been idle Spectators of these dreadful
Fires (as</i> Nero <i>was of flaming</i> Rome<i>) but have endeavour'd by
their wicked Speeches and Libels to blow the Bellows, whilst few or
none have contributed their Assistance towards the extinguishing
them.</i></p>

<p><i>I am not ignorant how mean and inconsiderable a Man I am;
nevertheless as in a general Conflagration every Man's Help is
acceptable, who is able to fling on but a Bucket of Water, so I
hope the Endeavours of any Person that offers at a Remedy will be
well taken by every Lover of his Country. Being very intent for
several Months past on the Thoughts of these great Calamities, I
have perused all the old</i> French <i>and</i> German <i>Historians
that treat of our</i> Francogallia, <i>and collected out of their
Works a true State of our</i> Commonwealth; <i>in the Condition
(wherein they agree) it flourished for above a Thousand Years. And
indeed the great Wisdom of our Ancestors in the first framing of
our Constitution, is almost incredible; so that I no longer
doubted, that the most certain Remedy for so great Evils must be
deduced from their Maxims.</i></p>

<p><i>For as I more attentively enquired into the Source of these
Calamities, it seemed to me, that even as human Bodies decay and
perish, either by some outward Violence, or some inward Corruption
of Humours, or lastly, thro' Old Age: So Commonwealths are brought
to their Period, sometimes by Foreign Force, sometimes by Civil
Dissentions, at other Times by being worn out and neglected. Now
tho' the Misfortunes that have befallen our Commonwealth are
commonly attributed to our Civil Dissentions, I found, upon
Enquiry, these are not so properly to be called the</i> Cause <i>as
the</i> Beginning <i>of our Mischiefs. And</i> Polybius, <i>that
grave judicious Historian, teaches us, in the first place, to
distinguish the</i> Beginning <i>from the</i> Cause <i>of any
Accident. Now I affirm the</i> Cause <i>to have been that great
Blow which our Constitution received about 100 Years ago from that</i>
[Footnote: Lewis <i>the</i> XI.] <i>Prince, who ('tis manifest) first of
all broke in upon the noble and solid Institutions of our
Ancestors. And as our natural Bodies when put out of joint by
Violence, can never be recover'd but by replacing and restoring
every Member to its true Position; so neither can we reasonably
hope our Commonwealth shou'd be restor'd to Health, till through
Divine Assistance it shall be put into its true and natural State
again.</i></p>

<p><i>And because your Highness has always approv'd your self a
true Friend to our Country; I though it my Duty to inscribe, or, as
it were, to consecrate this Abstract of our History to your
Patronage. That being guarded by so powerful a Protection, it might
with greater Authority and Safety come abroad in the World.
Farewel, most illustrious</i> Prince; <i>May the great God Almighty
for ever bless and prosper your most noble Family.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_I" id="CHAP_I" />CHAP. I.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>The State of</i> Gaul, <i>before it was reduced
into a</i> Province <i>by the</i> Romans.</p>

<p>My Design being to give an Account of the Laws and Ordinances of
our <i>Francogallia</i>, as far as it may tend to the Service of
our <i>Commonwealth</i>, in its present Circumstances; I think it
proper, in the first place, to set forth the State of <i>Gaul</i>,
before it was reduced into the Form of a <i>Province</i> by the
<i>Romans</i>: For what <i>C&aelig;sar, Polybius, Strabo, Ammianus</i>,
and other Writers have told us concerning the <i>Origin,
Antiquity</i> and <i>Valour</i> of that People, the Nature and
Situation of their Country, and their private Customs, is
sufficiently known to all Men, tho' but indifferently learned.</p>

<p>We are therefore to understand, that the State of <i>Gaul</i>
was such at that time, that neither was the <i>whole</i> under the
Government of a <i>single Person</i>: Nor were the particular
[Footnote: <i>Civitas</i>, a Commonwealth.] <i>Commonwealths</i>
under the Dominion of the <i>Populace</i>, or the <i>Nobles</i>
only; but all <i>Gaul</i> was so divided into <i>Commonwealths</i>,
that the most Part were govern'd by the <i>Advice</i> of the
<i>Nobles</i>; and these were called <i>Free</i>; the rest had
<i>Kings</i>. But every one of them agreed in this
<i>Institute</i>, that at a certain Time of the Year a <i>publick
Council</i> of the whole Nation should be held; in which
<i>Council</i>, whatever seem'd to relate to the whole <i>Body</i>
of the <i>Commonwealth</i> was appointed and establish'd.
<i>Cornelius Tacitus</i>, in his 3d Book, reckons Sixty-four
<i>Croitates</i>; by which is meant (as <i>C&aelig;sar</i> explains it)
so many Regions or Districts; in each of which, not only the same
<i>Language, Manners</i> and <i>Laws</i>, but also the same
<i>Magistrates</i> were made use of. Such, in many Places of his
History, he principally mentions the Cities of the <i>&AElig;dui</i>,
the <i>Rhemi</i> and <i>Arverni</i> to have been. And therefore
<i>Dumnorix</i> the <i>&AElig;duan</i>, when <i>C&aelig;sar</i> sent to have
him slain, began to resist, and to defend himself, and to implore
the Assistance of his <i>Fellow Citizens</i>; often crying out,
That he was a <i>Freeman</i>, and Member of a <i>Free
Commonwealth</i>, lib. 5. cap. 3.</p>

<p>To the like purpose Strabo writes in his Fourth Book: [Footnote:

"<i>Most</i> of the <i>Commonwealths</i> (says he) were govern'd by
the <i>Advice</i> of the <i>Nobles</i>: but every <i>Year</i> they
anciently chose a <i>Magistrate</i>; as also the People chose a
<i>General</i> to manage their Wars." The like <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, lib.
6. Cap. 4. writes in these Words: "Those <i>Commonwealths</i> which
are esteem'd to be under the best Administration, have made a Law,
that if any Man chance to hear a Rumour or Report abroad among the
Bordering People, which concerned the <i>Commonwealth</i>, he ought
to inform the <i>Magistrates</i> of it, and communicate it to no
body else. The <i>Magistrates</i> conceal what they think proper,
and acquaint the Multitude with the rest: For of Matters relating
to the <i>Community</i>, it was not permitted to any Person to talk
or discourse, but in <i>Council</i>."&mdash;Now concerning
this <i>Common Council</i> of the whole Nation,
we shall quote these few Passages out of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>. "They
demanded, (says he) <i>lib.</i> 1. <i>cap.</i> 12. a <i>General
Council</i> of <i>all Gallia</i> to be summon'd; and that this
might be done by <i>C&aelig;sar</i>'s Consent." Also, <i>lib.</i> 7.
<i>cap.</i> 12.&mdash;"a <i>Council</i> of all <i>Gallia</i> was
summon'd to meet at <i>Bibracte</i>; and there was a vast Concourse
from all Parts to that Town."&mdash;And <i>lib.</i> 6. <i>cap.</i>
1&mdash;"<i>C&aelig;sar</i> having summon'd the <i>Council</i> of <i>Gaul</i>
to meet early in the Spring, as he had before determin'd: Finding
that the <i>Senenes, Carnates</i> and <i>Treviri</i> came not when
all the rest came, he adjourned the <i>Council</i> to
Paris."&mdash;And, <i>lib</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 6. speaking of
<i>Vercingetorix</i>,&mdash;"He promis'd himself, that he shou'd be
able by his Diligence to unite such <i>Commonwealths</i> to him as
dissented from the rest of the Cities of <i>Gaul</i>, and to form a
<i>General Council</i> of all <i>Gallia</i>; the Power of which,
the whole World should not be able to withstand."</p>

<p>Now concerning the <i>Kings</i> which ruled over certain Cities
in <i>Gallia</i> the same Author makes mention of them in very many
Places; Out of which this is particularly worthy our Observation:
That it was the <i>Romans</i> Custom to caress all those
<i>Reguli</i> whom they found proper for their turns: That is, such
as were busy men, apt to embroil Affairs, and to sow Dissentions or
Animosities between the several <i>Commonwealths</i>. These they
joined with in Friendship and Society, and by most honourable
publick Decrees called them their <i>Friends</i> and
<i>Confederates</i>: And many of these <i>Kings</i> purchased, at a
great Expence, this Verbal Honour from the <i>Chief Men</i> of
<i>Rome</i>. Now the <i>Gauls</i> called such, <i>Reges</i>, or
rather <i>Reguli</i>, which were chosen, not for a certain Term,
(as the Magistrates of the Free Cities were) but for their Lives;
tho' their Territories were never so small and inconsiderable: And
these, when Customs came to be changed by Time, were afterwards
called by the Names of <i>Dukes, Earls</i>, and
<i>Marquisses</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Commonwealths</i> or <i>Cities</i>, some were much
more potent than others; and upon these the lesser
<i>Commonwealths</i> depended; these they put themselves under for
Protection: Such weak Cities <i>C&aelig;sar</i> sometimes calls the
<i>Tributaries</i> and <i>Subjects</i> of the former; but, for the
most part he says, they were in <i>Confederacy</i> with them.
<i>Livius</i> writes, <i>lib. 5</i>. that when <i>Tarquinius
Priscus</i> reigned in <i>Rome</i>, the <i>Bituriges</i> had the
principal Authority among the <i>Celt&aelig;</i>, and gave a <i>King</i>
to them. When <i>C&aelig;sar</i> first enter'd <i>Gaul</i>, A.U.C. 695.
he found it divided into Two Factions; the <i>&AElig;dui</i> were at the
Head of the one, the <i>Arverni</i> of the other, who many Years
contended for the Superiority: But that which greatly increas'd
this Contention, was, Because the <i>Bituriges</i>, who were next
Neighbours to the <i>Arverni</i>, were yet <i>in file &amp;
imperio</i> that is, Subjects and Allies to the <i>&AElig;dui</i>. On
the other hand, the <i>Sequani</i> (tho' Borderers on the
<i>&AElig;dui</i>) were under the Protection of the <i>Arverni</i>, lib.
1. Cap. 12. lib. 6. cap. 4. The <i>Romans</i> finding such-like
Dissention; to be for their Interest; that is, proper Opportunities
to enlarge their own Power, did all they cou'd to foment them: And
therefore made a League with the <i>&AElig;dui</i>, whom (with a great
many Compliments) they titled <i>Brothers and Friends of the People
of Rome</i>. Under the Protection and League of the <i>&AElig;dui</i>, I
find to have been first the <i>Senones</i>, with whom some time
before the <i>Parisians</i> had join'd their <i>Commonwealth</i> in
League and Amity. Next, the <i>Bellouaci</i>, who had nevertheless
a great City of their own, abounding in Numbers of People, and were
of principal Authority and Repute among the <i>Belg&aelig;</i>, lib. 2.
cap. 4. and lib. 7. cap. 7. <i>C&aelig;sar</i> reckons the
<i>Centrones</i>, <i>Grudii</i>, <i>Levaci</i>, <i>Pleumosii</i>,
<i>Gordunni</i>, under the Dominion of the <i>Nervii</i>, lib. 5.
cap. 11. He names the <i>Eburones</i> and <i>Condrasii</i> as
Clients of the <i>Treviri</i>, lib. 4. cap. 2. And of the
<i>Commonwealth</i> of the <i>Veneti</i> (these are in
<i>Armorica</i> or <i>Brittanny</i>) he writes, that their
Domination extended over all those Maritime Regions; and that
almost all that frequented those Seas were their Tributaries,
<i>lib.</i> 3. <i>cap.</i> 2. But the Power of the <i>Arverni</i>
was so great, that it not only equall'd that of the &AElig;dui, but a
little before <i>C&aelig;sar</i>'s Arrival, had got most of their
Clients and Dependents from them, <i>lib.</i> 6 <i>cap.</i> 4.
<i>lib.</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 10. Whereupon, as Strabo writes in his
4th Book, they made War against <i>C&aelig;sar</i> with Four hundred
thousand Men under the Conduct of their General
<i>Vercingetorix</i>. These were very averse to Kingly Government:
So that <i>Celtillus</i>, Father to <i>Vercingetorix</i>, a Man of
great Power and Reputation (reckon'd the first Man in all
<i>Gaul</i>,) was put to Death, by <i>Order</i> of his
<i>Commonwealth</i>, for aspiring to the <i>Kingdom</i>. The
<i>Sequani</i>, on the other hand, had a King, one
<i>Catamantales</i>, to whom the <i>Romans</i> gave the Title of
their <i>Friend</i> and <i>Ally</i>, lib. 1. cap. 2. Also the
<i>Suessiones</i>, who were Masters of most large and fertile
Territories, with 12 great Cities, and cou'd muster Fifty thousand
fighting Men, had a little before that time <i>Divitiacus</i>, the
most potent Prince of all <i>Gallia</i> for their King; he had not
only the Command of the greatest Part of <i>Belg&aelig;</i>, but even of
<i>Britanny</i>. At <i>C&aelig;sar</i>'s Arrival they had one
<i>Galba</i> for their King, <i>lib.</i> 2. <i>cap.</i> 1. In
<i>Aquitania</i>, the <i>Grandfather</i> of one <i>Piso</i> an
<i>Aquitanian</i> reigned, and was called <i>Friend</i> by the
People of <i>Rome</i>, lib. 4. cap. 3. The <i>Senones</i>, a People
of great Strength and Authority among the <i>Gauls</i>, had for
some time <i>Moritasgus</i> their King; whose Ancestors had also
been Kings in the same Place, <i>lib.</i> 5. <i>cap.</i> 13. The
<i>Nitiobriges</i> or <i>Agenois</i>, had <i>Olovico</i> for their
King; and he also had the Appellation given him of <i>Friend</i> by
the <i>Senate</i> of <i>Rome</i>, lib. 7. cap. 6.</p>

<p>But concerning all these Kingdoms, one thing is remarkable, and
must not lightly be past by; which is That <i>they were not
hereditary</i>, but <i>conferr'd</i> by the <i>People</i> upon such
as had the Reputation of being just Men. Secondly, That they had no
<i>arbitrary</i> or <i>unlimited Authority</i>, but were bound and
<i>circumscribed</i> by <i>Laws</i>; so that they were no less
accountable to, and subject to the Power of the People, than the
People was to theirs; insomuch that those <i>Kingdoms</i> seem'd
nothing else but <i>Magistracies for Life</i>. For C&aelig;sar makes
mention of several <i>private Men</i>, whose <i>Ancestors</i> had
formerly been <i>such Kings</i>; among these he reckons
<i>Casticus</i>, the Son of <i>Catamantales</i>, whose Father had
been King of the <i>Sequani</i> many Years, <i>lib.</i> 1.
<i>cap.</i> 2. and <i>Piso</i> the <i>Aquitanian</i>, lib. 4. cap.
3. also <i>Tasgetius</i>, whose Ancestors had been Kings among the
<i>Carnutes</i>, lib. 5. cap. 8.</p>

<p>Now concerning the Extent of their <i>Power</i> and
<i>Jurisdiction</i>, he brings in <i>Ambiorix</i>, King of the
<i>Eburones</i>, giving an account of it, <i>lib.</i> 5.
<i>cap.</i> 8. "The Constitution of our Government is such (says
he) that the People have no less Power and Authority over me than I
have over the People. <i>Non minus habet in me juris multitudo,
quam ipse in multitudinem</i>." Which Form of Government, <i>Plato,
Aristotle, Polybius</i> and <i>Cicero</i> have for this Reason
determined to be the <i>best</i> and <i>most Excellent</i>:
"Because (says <i>Plato</i>) shou'd Kingly Government be left
without a Bridle, when it has attained to supreme Power, as if it
stood upon a slippery Place, it easily falls into Tyranny: And
therefore it ought to be restrained as with a Curb, by the
Authority of the Nobles; and such chosen men as the People have
empower'd to that End and Purpose."</p>

<p class="one"><i>Probable Conjectures concerning the</i> ancient
Language <i>of the</i> Gauls.</p>

<p>In this Place it seems proper to handle a Question much disputed
and canvass'd by Learned Men; <i>viz</i>. What was the Language of
the Gauls in those old Times? For as to what belongs to their
Religion, Laws, and the Customs of the People, <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, as I
said before, has at large given us an account. In the first place
we ought to take notice, that <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, in the Beginning of his
Commentaries, where he divides the Gauls into Three Nations, the
<i>Belg&aelig;</i>, the <i>Aquitan&aelig;</i>, and the <i>Celt&aelig;</i>, tells
us they all differ'd, not only in their <i>Customs</i>, but in
their <i>Language</i>: [Footnote: &alpha;&lambda;&lambda;
&#941;&nu;&#943;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&#972;&nu;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&tau;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&tau;&alpha;&#970;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&lambda;&#974;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&sigmaf;] Which also
<i>Strabo</i> confirms, <i>lib.</i> 4. where he says they were not
&#972;&mu;&omicron;&gamma;&lambda;&#974;&tau;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
of one Language, but a little differing in their Languages. And the
same thing <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> testifies in his 15th Book.
But what many Learned Men (especially of our own Country) have
maintain'd, <i>viz</i>. That the <i>Gauls</i> commonly used the
<i>Greek Tongue</i>, may be refuted by this single Instance which
<i>C&aelig;sar</i> takes notice of <i>lib.</i> 5. <i>cap.</i> 12. That
when <i>Q. Cicero</i> was besieged in his Camp, he dispatched
Letters written in the <i>Greek</i> Language, "<i>Lest (if they
were intercepted) his Designs shou'd be discover'd by the</i>
Gauls." But to this some object, what <i>Strabo</i> writes,
<i>lib.</i> 4. <i>viz</i>. "That all Sorts of good Literature (and
especially that of the <i>Greek Language</i>) flourish'd at
<i>Marseilles</i> to such a degree, that the <i>Gauls</i>, by
the Example of the <i>Massilians</i>, were mightily delighted with
the <i>Greek</i> Tongue, insomuch that they began to write their
very Bargains and Contracts in it." Now to this there is a short
and ready Reply: For, in the first place, if the <i>Gauls</i>
learnt <i>Greek</i> by the Example of the <i>Massilians</i>, 'tis
plain, 'twas none of their Mother-tongue. Secondly, <i>Strabo</i>
in the same place clearly shows us, that the Fashion of writing
their Contracts in <i>Greek</i> began but in his Time, when all
<i>Gallia</i> was in Subjection to the <i>Romans</i>. Besides, he
speaks precisely only of those <i>Gauls</i> who were Borderers and
next Neighbours to the <i>Massilians</i>, of whom he says, that not
only many of their private Men, but even their Cities (by publick
Decrees, and proposing great Rewards) invited several Learned Men
of <i>Massilia</i> to instruct their Youth.</p>

<p>It remains that we shou'd clear that place in <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
where he tells us the <i>Gauls</i>, in their publick and private
Reckonings, <i>Gr&aelig;cis literis usos fuisse</i>. But let us see
whether the word <i>Gr&aelig;cis</i> in that place ought not to be left
out, not only as <i>unnecessary</i> but <i>surreptitious</i>. Since
it was sufficient to express <i>C&aelig;sar</i>'s Meaning to have said,
that the <i>Gauls</i> made no use of <i>Letters</i> or
<i>Writing</i> in the Learning of the <i>Druids</i>, but in all
other Matters, and in publick and private Accounts, they did make
use of <i>Writing</i>: For <i>uti litteris, to use Letters</i>, is
a frequent Expression for <i>Writing</i> among Latin Authors.
Besides, it had been a Contradiction to say the <i>Gauls</i> were
unskill'd in the <i>Greek</i> Tongue, as <i>C&aelig;sar</i> had averr'd
a little before; and afterwards to say, that they wrote all their
publick and private Accounts in <i>Greek</i>. As to what many
suppose, that the words <i>literis Gr&aelig;cis</i> in that place, are
not to be taken for <i>Writing Greek</i>, but only for the
<i>Characters</i> of the <i>Letters</i>; I can less approve of this
Explanation than the former; because though many ancient Writers
(as we just now said) frequently used the Expression, <i>Uti
litteris</i> for <i>Scribere</i>; yet I never observ'd, that any of
them ever used it to signify the <i>Forms</i> and <i>Fashions</i>
of the <i>Characters</i>. Neither does it make at all for their
Opinion, what <i>C&aelig;sar</i> says in the First Book of his
Commentaries, <i>viz</i>. That there were found in the
<i>Helvetian</i> Camp, Tablets, <i>literis Gr&aelig;cis conscriptas</i>;
as if the same Person, who had learnt to make use of the <i>Greek
Forms</i> of <i>Characters</i>, might not as easily have learnt the
<i>Greek Language</i>; or as if there might not be among the
<i>Helvetii</i>, <i>Priests</i> or <i>Gentlemens Sons</i>, who
might then have learnt <i>Greek</i>, as our's now learn
<i>Latin</i>; <i>Greek</i> being at that Time a Language in Vogue
and Esteem. The very Neighbourhood of the School of <i>Massilia</i>
is sufficient to confute that Opinion: And therefore <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
when he speaks of his own Letter to <i>Cicero</i>, tells us, he
sent that Letter written in <i>Greek Characters</i>, lest (in case
it were intercepted) his Designs shou'd be discover'd by the Enemy.
<i>Justinius</i>, lib. 20. says, there was a Decree of the Senate
made, that no <i>Carthaginian</i>, after that Time, shou'd study
the [Footnote: <i>Gr&aelig;cis literas</i>.] <i>Greek Language</i> or
<i>Writing</i>, lest he shou'd be able to speak or write to the
Enemy without an Interpreter. <i>Tacitus</i>, in his Book <i>de
moribus Germanorum</i>, tells us, that several Tombs and Monuments
were yet to be seen in the Confines of <i>Germany</i> and
<i>Swisserland</i> with <i>Greek</i> Inscriptions on them.
<i>Livius</i>, lib. 9. says, The <i>Roman</i> Boys formerly studied
the <i>Tuscan</i> Language, as now they do the <i>Greek</i>. And in
his 28th Book,&mdash;"<i>Hanibal</i> erected an Altar, and
dedicated it with a large Inscription of all his Atchievements, in
the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Punick</i> Tongues. <i>Idem Lib</i>. 40.
Both Altars and Inscriptions on them in the <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Latin</i> Tongues." Lastly, I cannot imagine, that <i>C&aelig;sar</i>
wou'd have expressed himself (if he had meant, as these wou'd have
him) <i>Gr&aelig;cis literis scribere</i>; but rather, <i>Gr&aelig;carum
literarum form&acirc;</i>, as we see in <i>Tacitus</i>, Lib. 11.
"<i>Novas literarum formas addidit</i>." He added new Characters of
Letters: Having found, that the <i>Greek</i> Literature was not
begun and perfected at once. And again,&mdash;"<i>Et forme literis
latinis qu&aelig; veterrimis Gr&aelig;corum</i>, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Now lest any body shou'd wonder, how the Word <i>Gr&aelig;cis</i>
crept into <i>C&aelig;sar</i>'s Text, I will instance you the like
Mischance in <i>Pliny</i>, <i>lib.</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 57. where
'tis thus written,&mdash;"<i>Gentium consensus tacitus primum
omnium conspiravit ut</i> IONUM <i>literis uterentur</i>." And
afterwards,&mdash;"<i>Sequens gentium consensus in tonsoribus
fuit</i>." And again,&mdash;"<i>Tertius consensus est in Horarum
observatione</i>." Now who is there that sees not plainly the Word
IONUM ought to be left out, as well because 'tis apparently
unnecessary, (for <i>Pliny</i> had no farther Design than to let us
know, that Men first of all consented in the Writing and Form of
their Letters) as because 'tis false, that the <i>Ionian</i>
Letters were the first invented; as <i>Pliny</i> himself in his
foregoing Chapter, and <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>lib.</i> 11. have told
us? I have observed however two Places, (<i>Gregorius
Turonensis</i>, lib. 5. and <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 3. cap. 41.)
wherein 'tis intimated, that the <i>Gauls</i> used the <i>Forms</i>
of the <i>Greek</i> Letters: For where they speak of King
<i>Chilperick</i>,&mdash;"<i>He added</i> (say they) <i>some
Letters to our Letters</i>; and those were, &#969;, &#968;, &#950;, &#966;;
and sent Epistles to the several Schools in his Kingdom, that the
Boys should be so taught." <i>Aimoinus</i> mentions only three
Letters, &#967;, &#952;, &#966;. But we must understand, that these
were <i>Franks</i>, not <i>Gauls</i>; or rather
<i>Franco-gauls</i>, who made use of their own native Language, the
<i>German</i> Tongue; not that ancient Language of the
<i>Gauls</i>, which had grown out of use under the <i>Roman</i>
Government: Besides, if the <i>Francogalli</i> had made use of the
<i>Greek</i> Letters, how came they at first to except these, when
they made use of all the rest? But we have said enough, and too
much of this Matter. As for their Opinion who believe that the
<i>Gauls</i> spoke the <i>German</i> Language, <i>C&aelig;sar</i>
confutes it in that single place, wherein he tells us, that
<i>Ariovistus</i>, by Reason of his long Conversation in
<i>Gallia</i>, spoke the <i>Gallick</i> Tongue.</p>

<p>Now for two Reasons their Opinion seems to me to be most
probable, who write, that the <i>Ancient Gauls</i> had a peculiar
Language of their own, not much differing from the <i>British</i>:
First, because <i>C&aelig;sar</i> tells us it was the Custom for these
<i>Gauls</i> who had a mind to be thoroughly instructed in the
Learning of the <i>Druyds</i>, to pass over into <i>Britain</i>;
and since the <i>Druyds</i> made no use of Books, 'tis agreeable to
Reason, that they taught in the same Language which was used in
<i>Gallia</i>. Secondly, because <i>Tacitus</i> in his Life of
<i>Agricola</i>, writes, that the Language of the <i>Gauls</i> and
<i>Britains</i> differ'd but very little: neither does that
Conjecture of <i>Beatus Rhenanus</i> seem unlikely to me, who
believes the Language which is now made use of in <i>Basse
Bretayne</i> [<i>Britones Britonantes</i>] to be the Remains of our
ancient Tongue. His Reasons for this Opinion may be better learn'd
from his own Commentaries, than told in this Place. The Language
which we at present make use of, may easily be known to be a
Compound of the several Tongues of divers Nations. And (to speak
plainly and briefly) may be divided into four Parts. One half of it
we have from the <i>Romans</i>, as every one that understands
<i>Latin</i> ever so little, may observe: For besides, that the
<i>Gauls</i> being subject to the <i>Romans</i>, wou'd naturally
fall into their Customs and Language, 'tis manifest that the
<i>Romans</i> were very industrious to propagate their Tongue, and
to make it universal, and (as it were) venerable among all Nations.
And to that End settled Publick Schools up and down, at <i>Autan,
Besancon, Lyons</i>, &amp;c. as <i>Valerius Maximus, Tacitus</i>,
and <i>Ausonius</i> tell us. The other half of it may be subdivided
thus. One third of it we hold from the <i>Ancient Gauls</i>,
another from the <i>Franks</i>, and the last from the <i>Greek</i>
Language: For it has been demonstrated long since by many Authors,
that we find innumerable <i>Frank</i> (that is, <i>German</i>)
Words (as we shall hereafter prove) in our daily Speech. And
several learned Men have shewn us, that many <i>Greek</i> Words are
adapted to our common Use, which we do not owe to the Learning and
Schools of the <i>Druyds</i>, (who I believe spoke no
<i>Greek</i>); but to the Schools and Conversation of the
<i>Massilians</i>, whom we formerly mentioned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III" />CHAP. III.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>The State of</i> Gaul, <i>after it was reduced
into the form of a</i> Province <i>by the</i> Romans.</p>

<p>'Tis very well known to all learned Men, that <i>Gaul</i>, after
having been often attempted with various Success, during a ten
Years War, and many Battels, was at last totally subdued by
<i>C&aelig;sar</i> and reduced into the Form of a Province. It was the
Misfortune of this most valiant and warlike People, to submit at
length to the <i>Great Beast</i>, as it is called in Scripture,
with which however they so strove for Empire for eight hundred
Years, (as <i>Josephus</i> informs us) that no Wars with any other
Nation, so much terrified <i>Rome</i>. And <i>Plutarch</i> in his
Lives of <i>Marcellus</i> and <i>Camillus; Appian</i> in his 2d
Book of the Civil Wars; <i>Livius, lib</i>. 8. &amp; 10. have
recorded, that the <i>Romans</i> were so afraid of the
<i>Gauls</i>, that they made a Law, whereby all the Dispensations
(formerly granted to Priests and old Men, from serving in their
Armies) were made void, in Case of any Tumult or Danger arising
from the <i>Gauls:</i> which <i>Cicero</i> takes notice of in his
2d <i>Philippick</i>. <i>C&aelig;sar</i> himself in his 6th Book, and
after him <i>Tacitus</i>, lib. <i>de moribus Germanorum</i>, do
testify, That there was a time wherein the <i>Gauls</i> excell'd
the <i>Germans</i> in Valour, and carried the War into their
Territories, settling Colonies (by reason of their <i>great</i>
Multitudes of People) beyond the <i>Rhine</i>.</p>

<p>Now <i>Tacitus</i> in his Life of <i>Agricola</i>, attributes,
the <i>Loss</i> of this their so remarkable <i>Valour</i>, to the
<i>Loss</i> of their Liberty. <i>"Gallos in bellis floruisse
accepimus, mox segnities cum otio intravit, amissa</i> Virtute
<i>pariter ac</i> Libertate&mdash;." And I hope the Reader will
excuse me, if the Love of my Country makes me add that remarkable
Testimony of the Valour of the <i>Gauls</i>, mentioned by
<i>Justin, lib.</i> 24.&mdash;"The <i>Gauls</i> (says he) finding
their Multitudes to increase so fast, that their Lands cou'd not
afford them sufficient Sustenance, sent out Three hundred thousand
Souls to seek for new Habitations. Part of these: seated themselves
in <i>Italy</i>; who both took and burnt the City of <i>Rome</i>.
Another part penetrated as far as the Shores of <i>Dalmatia</i>,
destroying infinite Numbers of the <i>Barbarians</i>, and settled
themselves at last in <i>Pannonia</i>. A hardy bold and warlike
Nation; who ventured next after <i>Hercules</i>, (to whom the like
Attempt gave a Reputation of extraordinary Valour, and a Title to
Immortality) to cross those almost inaccessible Rocks of the
<i>Alps</i>, and Places scarce passable by Reason of the Cold:
Where after having totally subdued the <i>Pannonians</i> they waged
War with the bordering Provinces for many Years.&mdash;And
afterwards&mdash;being encouraged by their Success, subdivided
their Parties; when some took their Way to <i>Gr&aelig;cia</i> some to
<i>Macedonia</i>, destroying all before them with Fire and Sword.
And so great was the Terror of the Name of the <i>Gauls</i>, that
several Kings (not in the least threatned by them) of their own
accord, purchased their Peace with large Sums of Money&mdash;. And
in the following Book, he says,&mdash;So great was the Fruitfulness
of the <i>Gauls</i> at that time, that like a Swarm they fill'd all
<i>Asia</i>. So that none of the <i>Eastern</i> Kings either
ventured to make War without a mercenary Army of <i>Gauls</i>, or
fled for Refuge to other than the <i>Gauls</i>, when they were
driven out of their Kingdoms." And thus much may suffice concerning
their warlike Praises and Fortitude, which (as <i>Tacitus</i> tells
us) was quite <i>gone, as soon as they lost their Liberty</i>. Yet
some Cities, or <i>Commonwealths</i>, (as <i>Plinius, lib. 4. cap.
11.</i> tells us) were permitted to continue free, after the
<i>Romans</i> had reduced <i>Gallia</i> to the Form of a Province.
Such were the <i>Nervii</i>, <i>Ulbanesses</i>, <i>Suessiones</i>
and <i>Leuci</i>. Also some of the Confederates: and among these he
reckons the <i>Lingones</i>, <i>Rhemi</i>, <i>Carnutes</i> and
<i>&AElig;dui</i>.</p>

<p>But we may easily learn from these Words of <i>Critegnatus</i>
the <i>Arvernian</i>, mentioned by <i>C&aelig;sar, lib. 7.</i> what the
Condition was of those <i>Commonwealths</i>, which had the
Misfortune to be reduced into the Form of a <i>Province</i>. "If"
(says he) "you are ignorant after what manner far distant Nations
are used by the <i>Romans</i>, you have no more to do, but to look
at our neighbouring <i>Gallia</i>, now reduced into the Form of a
Province: Which having its Laws and Customs chang'd, and being
subjected to the Power of the <i>Axes</i>, is oppress'd with
perpetual Slavery."</p>

<p>We are to understand, there were three kinds of Servitude, or
Slavery. First, <i>To have a Garison of Soldiers imposed upon them,
to keep them in Awe</i>; yet such Provinces as seemed peaceable and
quiet, had no great Armies maintained in them. For <i>Josephus</i>
writes in his 2d Book of the Hist. of the <i>Jews</i>, "That in the
Emperor <i>Titus's</i> time, the <i>Romans</i> had but 1200
Soldiers in Garison in all <i>Gaul</i>, altho'" (says he) "they had
fought with the <i>Romans</i> for their Liberty, almost 800 Years,
and had near as many Cities, as the <i>Romans</i> had
Garison-Soldiers." A Second Sort of Servitude was, when any
Province was made Tributary, and compelled to pay Taxes; and to
that End were forced to endure a Number of Tax-gatherers, that is,
<i>Harpies</i> and <i>Leeches</i>, which suck'd out the very Blood
of the <i>Provincials</i>. <i>Eutropius</i> tells us, in his 6th
Book, That <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, as soon as he had subdued <i>Gaul</i>,
impos'd a Tax upon it, by the Name of a Tribute, which amounted to
<i>H. S. Quadringenties:</i> which is about a Million of our
Crowns. A Third Sort of Servitude was, when the Provinces were not
permitted to be govern'd by their <i>own Laws</i>; but had
Magistrates and Judges, with full Power and Authority (<i>cum
imperio &amp; securibus</i>) over Life and Estate, sent them by the
People of <i>Rome</i>. This Threefold Slavery not only our
<i>Gallia</i>, but all the other Provinces, took most bitterly to
heart; and therefore in <i>Tiberius's</i> Reign, not long after
<i>C&aelig;sar's</i> Conquest, <i>Tacitus</i> tells us, That the Cities
of <i>Gaul</i> rebell'd, because of the Continuance of Taxes, the
Extortions of Usurers, and Insolence of the Soldiery. And
afterwards in <i>Nero's</i> Reign, <i>Suetonius</i> writes, "That
the <i>Gauls</i> being weary of his Tyranny, revolted. The World"
(says he) "having for near 13 Years, endured such a Sort of Prince,
at last shook him off: The <i>Gauls</i> beginning the Defection."
Now all <i>Gallia</i> was divided by the <i>Romans</i> into 16
Provinces, <i>viz. Viennensis, Narbonensis prima, Narbonensis
secunda, Aquitania prima, Aquitania secunda, Novempopulana, Alpes
maritim&aelig;, Belgica prima, Belgica secunda, Germania prima, Germania
secunda, Lugdunensis prima, Lugdunensis secunda, Lugdunensis
tertia, Maxima Sequanorum, &amp; Alpes Gr&aelig;c&aelig;</i>, as
<i>Antoninus</i> in his <i>Itinerary</i>, and <i>Sextus Rufus</i>,
give an Account of them. But <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> treats of
them more particularly.</p>

<p>But to return to what we were speaking of: 'Tis not to be
imagined how grievously, and with what Indignation the <i>Gauls</i>
bore the Indecencies and Plunderings of the <i>Romans</i>; nor how
frequently they revolted upon that Account and because they were
not strong enough of themselves to shake off the <i>Roman</i>
Tyranny, 'twas common Custom with them, to hire <i>German</i>
Auxiliaries. These were the first beginnings of the Colonies of the
<i>Franks</i>; For those <i>Germans</i>, whether they were beaten
by the <i>Romans</i>, or (which is more likely) were bought off by
them, began by little and little, to settle themselves in the
borders of <i>Gallia</i>. This gave to <i>Suetonius</i>, in his
Life of <i>Augustus</i>, to say,&mdash;"He drove the <i>Germans</i>
beyond the River <i>Elb</i>; but the <i>Suevi</i> and
<i>Sicambri</i> (submitting themselves); he transplanted into
<i>Gallia</i> where he assign'd them Lands near the river
<i>Rhine</i>."&mdash;Also in his Life of <i>Therius</i>,&mdash;"He
brought (says he) forty thousand of those that had surrendred
themselves in the <i>German</i> War, over into <i>Gallia</i>, and
allotted them Settlements upon the Banks of the
<i>Rhine</i>."&mdash;Neither must we omit what <i>Flavius
Vepiscus</i> records, concerning the Reign of <i>Probus</i> the
Emperor; in whose time almost all <i>Gallia</i>, that is, sixty
Cities, revolted from the <i>Romans</i>; and with common Consent,
took up Arms for the Recovery of' their Liberty:&mdash;"Having done
these things (says he) he march'd with a vast Army into
<i>Gaul</i>, which after <i>Posthumus's</i> Death was all in
Commotion, and when <i>Aurelianus</i> was kill'd, was In a Manner
possessed by the <i>Germans</i>; there he gain'd so many Victories,
that he recover'd from the <i>Barbarians</i> sixty of the most
noble Cities of <i>Gallia</i>: And whereas they had overspread all
<i>Gallia</i> without Controul, he slew near four hundred thousand
of those that had seated themselves within the <i>Roman</i>
Territories, and transplanted the Remainders of them beyond the
Rivers <i>Neckar</i>, and <i>Elb</i>."</p>

<p>But how cruel and inhuman the Domination of the <i>Romans</i>
was in <i>Gallia</i>: How intolerable their Exactions were: What
horrible and wicked Lives they led; and with how great Inveteracy
and Bitterness they were hated upon that Account by the
<i>Gauls</i>, (especially by the <i>Christians</i>) may best be
learn'd from the Works of <i>Salvianus</i>, Bishop of
<i>Marseilles</i>, which treat of Providence: Therefore 'tis
incredible to tell, what Multitudes of <i>Germans</i> pour'd
themselves into <i>Gallia</i>; the <i>Gauls</i> not only not
hindring, but even favouring and calling them in. <i>Latinus
Pacatus</i>, in his Speech to <i>Theodesius</i>, has this Passage;
"From whence shou'd I begin my Discourse, but from thy Mischiefs, O
<i>Gallia</i>! who may'st justly challenge a Superiority in
Sufferings, above all the Nations of the Earth, that have been
vexed with this Plague?"&mdash;Now 'tis most plain both from
<i>Sidonius Apollinaris</i>, and especially from the
above-mentioned <i>Salvianus</i>, in many Places of his Writings,
that our <i>Franks</i> were a Part of those <i>German</i> Nations,
who thus entred into <i>Gallia</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV" />CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Original of the</i> Franks; <i>who having
possessed themselves of</i> Gallia, <i>changed its Name, into that
of</i> Francia, <i>or</i> Francogallia.</p>

<p>The Order of our Discourse requires, that we should now enquire
into the Original of the <i>Franks</i>, and trace them from their
first Habitations, or (as it were) their very Cradles: In which
Disquisition 'tis very much to be admired, that no mention has been
made of them by <i>Ptolomy</i>, <i>Strabo</i>, or even by
<i>Tacitus</i> himself, who of all Writers was most accurate in
describing the Names and Situations of all the <i>German</i>
Nations: and 'tis plain, the <i>Franks</i> were a <i>German</i>
People, who possessed most part of <i>Europe</i> for many Years,
with great Reputation; of which we will quote but a few Instances
out of many.</p>

<p>First, <i>Johannes Nauclerus</i> says
thus,&mdash;"<i>Charles</i> the Great was call'd <i>King</i> of the
<i>Franks</i>; which is as much as to say, <i>King</i> of
<i>Germany</i> and <i>France</i>." Now 'tis demonstrable, that at
that time all <i>Gallia Transalpina</i>, and all <i>Germany</i>
from the <i>Pyren&aelig;en</i> Mountains, as far as <i>Hungary</i>, was
called <i>Francia</i>: This last was called <i>Eastern France</i>,
the former <i>Western France</i>; and in this all true Historians
agree.</p>

<p><i>Eguinarthus</i>, in his Life of <i>Charlemain</i>,
says,&mdash;"The Banks of the River <i>Sala</i>, which divides the
<i>Taringi</i> from the <i>Sorabi</i>, were afterwards inhabited by
those called the <i>Eastern Franks</i>." <i>Otto Frising</i>.
<i>Chron</i>. 5. <i>cap.</i> 4. speaking of King <i>Dagaber</i>'s
Reign, "The Bounds of the <i>Franks</i> Dominions reach'd now (says
he) from <i>Spain</i>, as far as <i>Hungary</i>, being two most
noble Dukedoms, <i>Aquitania</i> and <i>Bavaria</i>";&mdash;but
much more at large, <i>lib.</i> 6. <i>cap.</i> 17. And after him
<i>Godfrey</i> of <i>Viterbo</i>, in his <i>Chronic. part. 17. sub
Anno</i> 881, "<i>Arnulphus</i> (says he) ruled all <i>Eastern
Francia</i>, which is now called the <i>Teutonick</i> Kingdom, or
<i>Germany</i>; that is to say, <i>Bavaria, Suabia, Saxonia,
Turingia, Frisia</i> and <i>Lotharingia</i>; but <i>Odo</i> was
king of <i>Western France</i>." Again, <i>sub Anno</i> 913. "It is
apparent by the Authority of many Writers, that the Kingdom of
<i>Germany</i>, which the Emperor <i>Frederick</i> at present
holds, is part of the Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i>; for there (on
both sides of the <i>Rhine</i>) the first <i>Franks</i> were
seated; which as far as to the Limits of <i>Bavaria</i>, is now
called <i>Eastern France</i>: But <i>Western France</i> is that
Kingdom which lies on both Sides the Rivers <i>Seine</i> and
<i>Loire</i>"&mdash;And again he says, "In the time of
<i>Charles</i> the Great, King of the <i>Franks</i>, all
<i>Gallia</i>, that is, <i>Celtica, Belgica</i>, and
<i>Lugdunensis</i> and all <i>Germany</i> which reaches from the
<i>Rhine</i> as far as far as <i>Dalmatia</i>, made but one
Kingdom; which was called <i>Francia</i>"&mdash;Almost all which
Quotations have been taken out of <i>Otto</i>, as I said before.
'Tis to be noted, that <i>Rhegino</i> writes thus, in <i>Chron.
anni</i> 577.&mdash;"After the Death of King <i>Pipin</i>,
<i>Lewis</i> his Son (who had been present at his Father's Decease
and celebrated his Funerals) kept his Residence at
<i>Francfort</i>, the principal Seat of the <i>Eastern
Kingdom." Luitprandus Ticinensis</i> says, <i>lib. 1. cap</i>.
6.&mdash;"It was order'd that <i>Wido</i> shou'd have for his
Share, that which Men call the <i>Roman France</i>, and
<i>Berengarius</i> shou'd have Italy." And a little
after,&mdash;"When he had march'd thro' the Territories of the
<i>Burgundians</i>, he purposed to enter <i>Roman France</i>, &amp;c." Now
it was call'd <i>Roman France</i>, first, because the <i>Franks</i>
had possessed themselves of that <i>Gallia</i>, which was under the
<i>Roman</i> Obedience. Secondly, because the <i>Roman</i> Language
prevail'd in that Country, as we formerly told you: Whence arose
the Saying, <i>Loqui Romanum</i>, of such as used not the
<i>German</i> or <i>Frank</i>; but the <i>Latin</i> Tongue. Otto
Frisingius, chron. 4. <i>cap. penult.</i> says,&mdash;"It seems to
me, that those <i>Franks</i> who dwell in <i>Gallia</i>, borrowed
the Language, which they make use of to this Day, from the
<i>Romans</i>; for the others who stay'd about the <i>Rhine</i>,
and in <i>Germany</i> use the <i>Teutonick</i> Tongue."&mdash;And
in Imitation of him, <i>Godfridus</i>, part. 17. cap. 1.&mdash;"The
<i>Franks</i> (says he) seem to me to have learn'd the Language
which they make use of to this Day, from the <i>Romans</i>, who
formerly dwelt in those Parts&mdash;." From all these 'tis
apparent, that the Reputation and Power of the <i>Franks</i> was
extraordinary great; as 'twas fitting for such as were Masters of a
great Part of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover we find, that those <i>Germans</i> which were
transplanted by the Emperor <i>Frederick</i> the IId, into the
Kingdoms of <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>, and establish'd there
as a presidiary Colony, were called <i>Franks</i>. <i>Petrus de
Vineis, lib. epist. 6. cap. 25</i>. [Footnote: These are only
broken pieces of Sentences, to prove, that the <i>Germans</i>
(establish'd in <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>) were called, and
actually were <i>Franks</i>.] &mdash;"<i>Following (says he) the
Law and Custom of the</i> Franks, <i>in this Instance, that the
Eldest Brother to the Exclusion of all the Younger succeeds, even
in the Camp it self.</i>" Imp. Freder. 2. Neapol. constit. lib. 2.
tit. 32. speaking of those <i>Franks, "who upon Occasion trusted
the Fortune of their Lives, and of all their Estates, to the Event
of a Duel, or single Combat</i>." And again,&mdash;"<i>The
aforesaid manner of Proof, which all who observe the Rites of
the</i> Franks <i>made use of</i>"&mdash;.Also <i>lib. 2. tit.
33</i>.&mdash;"<i>which Law, our Will is, shall in all Causes be
common both to the</i> Franks <i>and</i> Longobards."</p>

<p>Matters being thus plain, 'tis strange that <i>Gregory</i>
Bishop of <i>Tours</i> (who writ concerning the Original of the
<i>Franks</i> 800 Years ago) shou'd say, in the first Part of his
History, That altho' he had made diligent Enquiry about the Rise
and Beginning of the <i>Franks</i>, he could find nothing certain:
notwithstanding he had seen an ancient Book of a certain Historian
of theirs, called, <i>Salpitius Alexander</i>; who affirms nothing,
either of their first Habitations, or the Beginnings of their
Domination.</p>

<p>But we have found out, that these People originally came from
that Country which lies between the <i>Rhine</i> and the
<i>Elb</i>, and is bounded on the <i>West</i> by the Sea, almost
in the same Tract where the greater and the lesser <i>Chauci</i>
dwelt. "A People (says <i>Tacitus</i>) the most noble among all the
<i>Germans</i>, who founded their Greatness and maintained it by
Justice." These were next Neighbours to the <i>Batavians</i>; for
'tis agreed on all Hands, that the <i>Franks</i> had their first
Seats near the Sea-shore, in very marshy Grounds; and were the most
skilful People in Navigation, and Sea-fights, known at that time:
Whereof we have the following Testimonies. First, in
<i>Claudian</i>, who congratulating <i>Stilicon's</i> Victory,
writes thus;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&mdash;<i>Ut jam trans fluvium non indignante</i> Chayco
<i>Paseat</i> Belga <i>pecus, mediumque ingressa per</i>
Albin Gallica Francorum <i>montes armenta pererrent</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>In which Place he makes use of a Poetical License, and calls
those People <i>Chayci</i>, which the Geographers call
<i>Chauci</i>. Now that they were seated near the Sea, that
Panegyrical Oration made to <i>Constantine</i> the Great, is a
Testimony: "<i>Quid loquar rursus</i>, &amp;c. What should I speak
more of those remote Nations of the <i>Franks</i>, transplanted not
from Places which the <i>Romans</i> of old invaded; but plucked
from their very original Habitations, and their <i>farthest
Barbarous Shores</i>, to be planted in the waste Places of
<i>Gallia</i>; where with their Husbandry, they may help the
<i>Roman</i> Empire in time of Peace; and with their Bodies, supply
its Armies in time of War&mdash;." And in another Panegyrick, by
<i>Eumenius</i> the Rhetorician, we find this Passage, "<i>Aut h&aelig;c
ipsa</i>, &amp;c. Or this Country, which was once overspread with
the Fierceness of the <i>Franks</i>, more than if the Waters of
their Rivers, <i>or their Sea</i>, had cover'd it;" but now ceases
to be barbarous, and is civilized. To the same Purpose is
<i>Procopius</i> Testimony, in his first Book of the <i>Gothick
War</i>; for where he describes the place where the <i>Rhine</i>
falls into the Ocean; "In these Parts (says he) there are great
Marshes, where of old the <i>Germans</i> dwelt; a barbarous People,
and at that time of small Reputation, which now are called
<i>Franks</i>&mdash;." And <i>Zonaras</i>, in the 3d Tome of his
<i>Annals</i>, quotes this very Passage of <i>Procopius</i>. Also
<i>Flavius Vopiscus</i>, in his Life of <i>Probus</i>, tells us,
That the <i>Franks</i> were discomfited by <i>Probus</i> in their
inaccessible Marshes.&mdash;<i>Testes sunt Franci inviis strati
paludibus</i>. Also <i>Sidonius Apollinaris</i> says thus;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"<i>Francorum &amp; penitissimas paludes</i>,</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Intrares venerantibus Sicambris</i>."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now what we have said concerning the Neighbourhood of the
<i>Franks</i> to the <i>Chauci</i>, may be plainly proved by
comparing of Places, and the Descriptions of their particular
Seats. Those of the <i>Chauci</i> are described by <i>Pliny</i>,
<i>lib.</i> 16. <i>cap.</i> 1. Those of the <i>Franks</i> by the
<i>Rhetorician Panegyrist</i>, above mentioned: For <i>Pliny</i>
says thus, "We have seen in the <i>Northern</i> parts the Nations
of the <i>Chauci</i>, called <i>Majores &amp; Minores</i>, where
twice every 24 Hours the Ocean is forcibly driven in a great way
over the Land; thro' a vast Passage which is there, making it a
perpetual Controversy of Nature; and a Doubt, whether it ought to be
reckon'd part of the Land or of the Sea."</p>

<p>The Panegyrist speaks in these Terms, "<i>&mdash;Quanquam illa
Regio</i>, &amp;c. When thy noble Expeditions, O <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, have
proceeded so far, as to clear and conquer that Country, which the
<i>Rhine</i> runs through, with his cunning M&aelig;anders or Windings,
[<i>Meatibus callidis</i>, for so it must be read, and not
<i>Scaldis</i>, as in some Copies,] and embraces in his Arms a
Region, which I can scarce call Land; 'tis so soak'd with Water,
that not only the Marshy part of it gives way, but even that which
seems more firm, shakes when trod upon, and trembles at a Distance
under the Weight of the Foot."</p>

<p>We think therefore we have made it plain from what <i>Seats</i>
the Nation of the <i>Franks</i> first came into <i>Gallia</i>; that
is to say, from that marshy Country which lies upon the <i>Ocean</i>,
between the Rivers <i>Elb</i> and <i>Rhine</i>: which may be
further confirm'd by this Argument. That the <i>Franks</i> were
very well skill'd in maritime affairs, and sail'd far and near all
about those Coasts; For so says <i>Eutropius</i>, <i>lib.</i> 9.
where he gives a short History of the Emperor <i>Galienus</i>.
"After this time, when <i>Carausius</i> had in charge to scour the
Sea-coasts of <i>Belgia</i> and <i>Armorica</i>, then infested by
the <i>Franks</i> and <i>Saxons</i>, &amp;c." The very same thing
<i>Paulus Orosius</i> mentions, <i>lib.</i> 7. Also what the
<i>Panegyrist</i>, before cited, says in a certain Place, has
Reference to this.&mdash; "The <i>Franks</i> (says he) are cruel
above all others; the tide of whose warlike Fury surmounting that
of their very Ocean it self, carried them to the Sea-coasts of
<i>Spain</i>, which they very much infelted with their
Depredations." And therefore the Emperor <i>Justinian</i>, when he
explains to the <i>General Governor</i> of <i>Africk</i> the duty
of his Office, makes mention of those <i>Franks</i> which were
seated in a certain part of <i>Gallia</i>, bordering upon
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>But we find a very memorable Passage; which highly sets forth
the great Glory of their war-like Atchievements, in another place
of that Panegyrick; <i>viz.</i> That a small Body of <i>Franks</i>,
which <i>Probus</i>, the Emperor had overcome and carried captive
into <i>Pontus</i>, seiz'd on some Ships, wandred all about the
Sea-coasts of <i>Gr&aelig;cia</i> and <i>Asia</i>, invaded
<i>Sicily</i>, took <i>Syracusa</i>, and afterwards laden with
Booty, return'd into the Ocean thro' the <i>Streights</i> of
<i>Gibraltar</i>. "Recursabat in animos sub <i>Divo Probo</i> &amp;
paucorum ex <i>Francis</i> Captivorum incredibilis audacia, &amp;
indigna foelicitas: qui &agrave; Ponto usque correptis navibus,
Gr&aelig;ciam Asiamque populati, nec impun&egrave; plerisque Lybi&aelig;
littoribus appulsi, ipsas postrem&ograve; navalibus quondam
victoriis nobiles ceperant Syracusas: &amp; immenso itinere
permensi, Oceanum, qua terras rupit intraverant: atque ita eventu
temeritatis, offenderant, nihil esse clausum piratic&aelig;
desperationi qu&ograve; navigiis pateret accessus."</p>

<p>And, as farther Arguments of what I have been proving, may be
added all those Places in several Authors, which inform us that the
Habitations of the <i>Franks</i> were Bordering upon the
<i>Batavians</i>. The same <i>Rhetorician</i>, in his Speeches to
<i>Maximianus</i> and <i>Constantine</i>, says,&mdash;"Many
thousand <i>Franks</i>, who had crossed the <i>Rhine</i>, and
invaded <i>Batavia</i>, with other Countries on this Side, were
slain, driven out, or carried away captive."</p>

<p>Besides there is a notable Instance in <i>Corn. Tacitus</i>,
lib. 20. where speaking of the Neighbourhood of <i>Frisia</i> and
<i>Batavia</i> to each other, he mixes the <i>Caninesates</i> among
them, whose Custom in Electing their Kings was, (as I shall
hereafter shew) the very same with that of the
Franks.&mdash;"Ambassadors (says he) were sent to the
<i>Caninesates</i>, to persuade them to enter into the Confederacy:
That People inhabit one part of the Island, equal as to their
Descent, Laws and Valour, to the <i>Batavians</i>; but inferior in
Number.&mdash;And again&mdash;<i>Brinnio</i> being set upon a
Shield (according to the Custom of the Country) and hoisted up on
Men's Shoulders, was chosen their Commander." Which Words will
prove of no small Authority for us, when we come hereafter to that
Part of the Controversy.</p>

<p>The Case being so; I cannot forbear wondring at the Opinion of
the Learned <i>Andreas Tarnebus</i>, who despising the Authority of
so many grave and ancient Writers, says, that he thinks the
<i>Franks</i> were originally of <i>Scandinavia</i>: because in
<i>Ptolomy</i> he finds the <i>Phirassi</i> seated in that
Peninsula, which Word he will needs suppose to be corrupted; and
that, instead of it, the Word <i>Franci</i> ought to be there: but
brings no Reason for his Opinion more than his own mere guess, tho'
this Opinion differs manifestly from all other ancient Authors.</p>

<p>As to all those who are pleas'd with Fables, and have deduced
the Original of the <i>Franks</i> from the <i>Trojans</i>, and from
one <i>Francion</i>, a Son of <i>Priam</i>, we can only say, that
they furnish Materials for <i>Poets</i> rather than
<i>Historians</i>: And among such, <i>William Bellay</i> deserves
the first Place; who, tho' he was a Person of singular Learning and
extraordinary Ingenuity; yet in his Book, which treats of the
Antiquities of <i>Gallia</i> and <i>France</i>, seems rather to
have design'd a <i>Romance</i>, like that of <i>Amadis</i>, than a
true History of the <i>Francogallican</i> Affairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/051a.jpg" alt=
"Ornament" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V" />CHAP. V.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Name of the</i> Franks, <i>and their
sundry Excursions; and what time they first began to establish a
Kingdom in</i> Gallia.</p>

<p>But I think it requisite that we should enquire a little more
carefully into this Name of <i>Franks</i>; which, as we told you
before, is not to be found in any of the ancient Descriptions of
<i>Germany</i>. That I may no longer detain the Reader in Suspence,
it must needs be, that either the Nation of the <i>Franks</i>, by
which such mighty things were done, was at first very obscure and
mean, (as we see in <i>Switz</i>, an ordinary Village) yet because
the first beginning of the Liberty of those Countries proceeded
from thence, gave the name of <i>Switzers</i> to all the rest of
the <i>Cantons</i>: Or (which seems to me most probable) this
Appellation had its Original from the Occasion; <i>viz.</i> When those
that set up for the prime Leaders and Beginners, in recovering the
publick Liberty, called themselves <i>Franks</i>; by which name the
<i>Germans</i> understood such as were <i>Free</i>, and under no
Servitude; as the Writers of that Nation do unanimously hold: And
therefore in ordinary Speech, by a <i>Frank</i> was meant a
<i>Freeman</i>, by a <i>Franchise</i>, an <i>Asylum</i>, or Place
of Refuge; and <i>Francisare</i> signified to restore to liberty
and freedom. The first Proof we shall give of this, is, what
<i>Procopius</i> in his first Book of the Gothick Wars relates. The
<i>Franks</i> (says he) were anciently by a general name call'd
<i>Germans</i>; but after they exceeded their Limits, they obtain'd
the name of <i>Franks</i>: Of the same Opinion I find <i>Gregory of
Tours</i>, the <i>Abbot</i> of <i>Ursperg</i>; <i>Sigibertus</i>
and <i>Ado</i> of <i>Vienne</i>, and <i>Godfrey</i> of
<i>Viterbo</i> to have been, <i>viz.</i> That they had the Name of
<i>Franks</i> from their <i>freedom</i>, and from their
<i>ferocity</i>, (alluding to the sound, of the words <i>Francos
Feroces</i>), because they refused to serve as Soldier under
<i>Valentinian</i> the Emperor, and to pay Tribute as other Nations
did. A second Proof may be that of <i>Cornelius Tacitus</i>, who in
his 20th Book, speaking of the <i>Caninesates</i>, whom we have
formerly demonstrated to have been the very-next Neighbours, if not
the true <i>Franks</i> themselves, and, of their Victory over the
<i>Romans</i>, he has this expression: <i>Clara ea victoria,
&amp;c</i>. "That Victory (says he) was of great Reputation to them
immediately after it, and of great Profit in the Sequel; for having
by that Means got both Weapons and Ships into their Possession,
which before they were in great want of; their Fame was spread over
all <i>Germany</i> and <i>Gaul</i>, as being the first beginners of
liberty;" <i>Libertatis Auctores celebrabantur.</i> For the
<i>Germans</i> thereupon sent Ambassadors, offering their
Assistance. May the <i>Omen</i> prove lucky! and may the
<i>Franks</i> truly and properly deserve that name; who after
having shaken off that Yoke of <i>Slavery</i>, imposed upon them by
<i>Tyrants</i>, have thought fit to preserve to themselves a
commendable <i>liberty</i> even under the Domination of
<i>Kings</i>: <i>For to obey a King is not servitude</i>: neither
are all who are govern'd by Kings, presently for that Reason to be
counted <i>Slaves</i>, but such as submit themselves to the
unbounded Will of a <i>Tyrant</i>, a <i>Thief</i>, and
<i>Executioner</i>, as Sheep resign themselves to the Knife of the
Butcher. Such as these deserve to be called by the vile names of
<i>Servants</i> and <i>Slaves</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore the <i>Franks</i> had always <i>Kings</i>, even at
that very time when they profess'd themselves the
<i>vindicators</i> and <i>assertors</i> of the <i>publick
liberty</i>: And when they constituted <i>Kings</i>, they never
intended they shou'd be <i>Tyrants</i> or <i>Executioners</i>, but
<i>keepers</i> of their <i>Liberties, Protectors, Governors</i> and
<i>Tutors</i>. Such, in short, as we shall describe hereafter, when
we come to give an Account of the <i>Francogallican</i>
Government.</p>

<p>For, as to what a certain, foolish and ignorant <i>Monk</i>,
called <i>John Turpin</i>, has wrote (in his Life, or rather
Romance of <i>Charlemagn</i>) concerning the Origins of the Word
<i>Frank</i>, viz. That whoever contributed Money towards the
Building of St. <i>Denis's Church</i>, should be called
<i>Francus</i>, that is, a freeman, is not worthy of being
remembred, no more than all the rest of his trifling Works; stuft'd
full of old Wives Tales, and meer Impertinencies.</p>

<p>But this may be truly affirm'd, that this name of <i>Franks</i>,
or (as <i>Corn. Tacitus</i> interprets it) <i>Authors</i> of
<i>Liberty</i>, was an <i>Omen</i> so lucky and fortunate to them,
that through it they gain'd almost innumerable Victories. For after
the <i>Franks</i> had quitted their ancient Seats upon that
glorious Design, they deliver'd not only <i>Germany</i>, their
common Country, but also <i>France</i> from the Tyranny and
Oppression of the <i>Romans</i>; and at last (crossing the
<i>Alps</i>) even a great part of <i>Italy</i> itself.</p>

<p>The first mention made of this illustrious name, we find in
<i>Trebellius Pollios</i> Life of the Emperor <i>Gallienus</i>,
about the 260th Year after <i>Christ</i>. His Words are these:
"Cum, &amp;c. Whilst <i>Gallienus</i> spent his time in nothing but
Gluttony and shameful Practices, and govern'd the Commonwealth
after so ridiculous a manner, that it was like Boys play, when they
set up Kings in jest among themselves; the <i>Gauls</i>, who
naturally hate luxurious Princes, elected <i>Posthumus</i> for
their Emperor, who at that time was <i>Gallienus's</i> Lieutenant
in <i>Gaul</i> with imperial Authority. Gallienus thereupon
commenced a War with <i>Posthumus</i>; and <i>Posthumus</i> being
assisted by many Auxiliaries, both of the <i>Celt&aelig;</i> and the
<i>Franks</i>, took the Field along with <i>Victorinus</i>&mdash;."
By which Words we may plainly perceive, that the <i>Gauls</i>
crav'd the Assistance of the <i>Franks</i>; that is, of these
<i>Authors</i> or <i>Beginners of liberty</i>, to enable them to
shake off the Tyrant <i>Gallienus's</i> Yoke: Which same thing
<i>Zonaras</i> hints at in his Life of <i>Gallienus</i>, when he
says,
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#941;&mu;&#953;&#963;&epsilon; &delta;&#8050;
&#981;&rho;&#940;&gamma;&gamma;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&amp;c.&mdash;We find another mention made of the same People in
<i>Flavius Vopiscus's</i> Life of <i>Aurelian</i>, in these
Words:&mdash;"At Mentz the Tribune of the 6th Legion discomfited
the <i>Franks</i>, who had made Incursions, and overspread all
<i>Gallia</i>; he slew 700, and sold 300 Captives for
Slaves."&mdash;For you must not expect that our <i>Franks</i>, any
more than other Nations in their Wars, were constantly victorious,
and crown'd with Success. On the contrary, we read that
<i>Constantine</i>, afterwards call'd the <i>Great</i>, took
Prisoners two of their Kings, and exposed them to the Wild Beasts
at the publick shews. Which Story both <i>Eutropius</i> in his 9th
Book, and the <i>Rhetorician</i> in that Panegyrick so often
quoted, make mention of.</p>

<p>And because the same <i>Rhetorician</i> in another place speaks
of those Wars in the Confines of the <i>Batavi</i>, which we have
shewn not to be far distant from the <i>Franks</i>, I will set down
his Words at Length. <i>Multa Francorum millia, &amp;c</i>. "He
slew, drove out, and took Prisoners many thousand <i>Franks</i>,
who had invaded <i>Batavia</i>, and other Territories on this side
the <i>Rhine</i>." And in another Place says, "He clear'd the
Country of the <i>Batavians</i>, which had before been possess'd by
several Nations and Kings of the <i>Franks</i>; and not satisfied
with only overcoming them, he transplanted them into the
<i>Roman</i> Territories, and forced them to lay aside their
Fierceness as well as their Weapons." From which place we are given
to understand, not obscurely, that <i>Constantine</i>, (being
constrain'd to do so by the <i>Franks</i>) granted them Lands
within the Bounds of the <i>Roman</i> Empire. <i>Ammianus</i>, lib.
15. writes, that the <i>Franks</i>, during the Civil Wars between
<i>Constantine</i> and <i>Licinius</i>, sided with
<i>Constantine</i>, and fought very valiantly for him. And in other
places of the same Book he records, that during the Reign of
<i>Constantine</i>, the Son of <i>Constantine</i>, great numbers of
<i>Franks</i> were at that <i>Court</i> in high favour and
authority, with <i>C&aelig;sar</i>. "Afterwards, says he,
<i>Malarichus</i> on a sudden got power, having gained the
<i>Franks</i>; whereof at that time great numbers flourish'd at
Court."&mdash;During the Reign of <i>Julian</i>, call'd the
<i>Apostate</i>, the same <i>Franks</i> endeavour'd to restore the
City of <i>Cologne</i> (which was grievously oppress'd by
<i>Roman</i> Slavery) to its liberty: and forced it, after a long
Siege, to surrender thro' Famine; as the same <i>Ammianus</i> tells
us, <i>lib.</i> 12. And because one Band of those <i>Franks</i>
fix'd their Habitations upon the Banks of the River <i>Sala</i>,
they were thereupon called <i>Salii</i>; concerning whom he writes
in the same Book,&mdash;"Having prepar'd there things, he first of
all march'd towards the <i>Franks</i>; I mean those <i>Franks</i>
which were commonly called <i>Salii</i>, who had formerly with
great boldness fix'd their Habitations within the <i>Roman</i>
Territories, near a place called <i>Toxiandria</i>." Again, in his
20th Book he makes mention of that Country possess'd by the
<i>Franks</i> beyond the <i>Rhine</i>, and called
<i>Francia</i>.&mdash;"Having on a sudden pass'd the <i>Rhine</i>,
he enter'd the Country of those <i>Franks</i> called
<i>Attuarii</i>, a turbulent sort of People, who at that time made
great Havock on the Frontiers of <i>Gallia</i>."&mdash;And in his 30th
Book, where he speaks of King <i>Macrianus</i>, with whom
<i>Valentinian</i> the Emperor had lately made a Peace on the Banks
of the <i>Rhine</i>, in the Territory of <i>Mentz</i>,&mdash;"He
died, says he, in <i>Francia</i>, whilst he was utterly wasting
with Fire and Sword all before him, being kill'd in an Ambush laid
for him by that valiant King <i>Mellobandes</i>." Now of this
<i>Mellobandes</i>, King of the <i>Franks</i>, the same Author in his
following Book gives this Character; "That he was brave and
valiant, and upon the score of his Military Virtue constituted
great Master of the Houshold by the Emperor <i>Gratianus</i>, and
Lieutenant-General (in conjunction with <i>Nannienus</i>) of that
Army which was sent against the <i>Lentiates</i>, a People of
<i>Germany</i>." Afterwards, by virtue of a Treaty concluded
between the <i>Franks</i> and the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>, they
defended the Frontiers of the <i>Roman Gallia</i> against
<i>Stilicon</i>: For <i>Orosius</i> tells us in his last Book,
"That the Nations of the <i>Alani</i>, <i>Suevi</i> and
<i>Vandali</i>, being (together with many others) encouraged by
<i>Stilicon</i>; pass'd the <i>Rhine</i>, wasted the Territories of
the <i>Franks</i>, and invaded <i>Gallia</i>."</p>

<p>After the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>'s time, we have very little in
History extant concerning the <i>Frank</i>'s Warlike Deeds. For to
those Times must be apply'd what St. <i>Ambrose</i> writes in his
Letter (the 29th) to <i>Theodesius</i> the Emperor: That the
<i>Franks</i> both in <i>Sicily</i> and many other Places, had
overthrown <i>Maximus</i> the <i>Roman</i> General. "He (says he,
speaking of <i>Maximus</i>) was presently beaten by the
<i>Franks</i> and <i>Saxons</i> in all places of the Earth." But in
the Reign of <i>Valentinian</i> the 3d, that is, about the 450th
Year of <i>Christ</i>, 'tis plain, by the consent of all Writers,
that <i>Childeric</i>, the Son of <i>Meroveus</i>, King of the
<i>Franks</i>, compleated the Deliverance of <i>Gallia</i> from the
<i>Roman</i> Tyranny, after a continued Struggle of more than 200
Years; and was the first that established in <i>Gallia</i> a firm
and certain Seat of Empire: For altho' some reckon <i>Pharamond</i>
and <i>Clodio-crinitus</i> as the first Kings of the <i>Franks</i>,
yet without doubt there were many before them, who (like them) had
cross'd the <i>Rhine</i>, and made Irruptions into <i>Gallia</i>:
but none had been able to settle any peaceable Dominion within the
Limits of <i>Gallia</i>. Now <i>Meroveus</i>, who is commonly
reckon'd the 3d King; tho' he was indeed King of the <i>Franks</i>,
yet he was a Stranger and a Foreigner, not created King in
<i>Gallia</i>, not King of the <i>Francogalli</i>; that is to say,
not elected by the joint Suffrages of both Nations united: In
short, all these were Kings of the <i>Franci</i>, and not of the
<i>Francogalli</i>. But <i>Childeric</i>, the Son of
<i>Meroveus</i>, was (as we said before) the first that was elected
by the publick Council of the associated <i>Franks</i> and
<i>Gauls</i>, and he was created King; of <i>Francogallia</i>
presently after his Father <i>Meroveus</i> had been kill'd in a
Battel against <i>Attila</i>, during the Reign of
<i>Valentinian</i> the Third, a dissolute and profligate Prince. At
which time the <i>Angli</i> and <i>Scoti</i> took Possession of
<i>Great Britain</i>; the <i>Burgundians</i> of <i>Burgundy, Savoy
and Dauphine</i>; the <i>Goths</i> of <i>Aquitain</i>: the
<i>Vandals</i> of <i>Africk</i> and <i>Italy</i>, nay of
<i>Rome</i> it self; the <i>Hanni</i> under their Leader
<i>Attila</i> wasted <i>Gallia</i> with Fire and Sword. This
<i>Attila</i> having an Army of about Five hundred thousand Men,
over-ran all <i>Gallia</i> as far as <i>Thoulouse</i>.
<i>&AElig;tius</i> was at that time Governor of <i>Gallia</i>, who
fearing the Power of <i>Attila</i>, made a League with the
<i>Goths</i>, and by their assistance defeated <i>Attila</i> in a
Battel; wherein, 'tis said, they slew no fewer than a Hundred and
eighty thousand Men. But the Conqueror <i>&AElig;tius</i> being
suspected by <i>Valentinian</i> of aspiring to the Empire, was
afterwards, by his Command, put to Death; and within a little while
after, he himself was slain by <i>Maximus</i> before-mention'd.</p>

<p>During these Transactions, <i>Meroveus</i>, King of the
<i>Franks</i>, taking his Opportunity, pass'd the <i>Rhine</i>,
with a great Army; and joyning in Confederacy with many Cities, who
assisted in the common Cause of the publick Liberty, possess'd
himself at length of the innermost Cities belonging to the
<i>Celt&aelig;</i>, between the <i>Seine</i> and the <i>Garonne</i>. He
being dead, and both Nations (the <i>Gauls</i> and <i>Franks</i>)
united into one Commonwealth; they unanimously elected
<i>Childeric</i>, the Son of <i>Meroveus</i>, for their King,
placing him upon a Shield according to ancient Custom; and carrying
him upon their Shoulders thrice round the place of Assembly, with
great Acclamations of Joy, and universal Congratulation, saluted
him <i>King of Francogallia</i>. Of all which particulars,
<i>Sidonius Apollinaris</i>, <i>Gregorius Turonensis</i>, <i>Otto
Frising</i>, <i>Aimoinus</i> and others are Witnesses; whose
Testimonies we shall further produce, when we come to treat of the
Manner of the Inauguration of the King.</p>

<p>The Words of the same <i>Otto</i>, in the last Chapter but one
of his 4th Book concerning their taking possession of several
Cities, are these.&mdash;"The <i>Franks</i>, after having pass'd
the <i>Rhine</i>, in the first place put to flight the
<i>Romans</i>, who dwelt thereabouts; afterwards they took
<i>Tournay</i> and <i>Cambray</i>, Cities of <i>Gallia</i>; and
from thence gaining ground, by degrees they subdued <i>Rheims</i>,
<i>Soissons</i>, <i>Orleans</i>, <i>Cologne</i> and <i>Triers</i>."
And thus much may briefly be said touching the first King of
<i>Francogallia</i>. To which we shall only subjoin this Remark:
[Footnote: Hotoman's <i>Francogallia</i> was written <i>Anno</i>
1573.] <i>That altho' the Francogallican Kingdom</i> lasted from that time to this, almost One
thousand two hundred Years; yet during so long a space, there are
but three Families reckon'd to have possess'd the Throne,
<i>viz.</i> the Merovingians; who beginning from Meroveus,
continued it to their Posterity two hundred eighty three Years. The
<i>Carlovingians</i>, who drawing their Original from <i>Charles
the Great</i>, enjoy'd it 337 Years: And lastly, the
<i>Capevignians</i>, who being descended from <i>Hugh Capet</i>,
now rule the Kingdom, and have done so for Five hundred and eighty
Years past.</p>

<p class="one"><i>Whether the Kingdom of</i> Francogallia
<i>was</i> hereditary <i>or</i> elective; <i>and the manner of
making its</i> Kings.</p>

<p>But here arises a famous Question; the Decision of which will
most clearly show the Wisdom of our Ancestors.&mdash;<i>Whether the
Kingdom of Francogallia were Hereditary, or conferr'd by the
Choice and Suffrages of the People</i>, That the <i>German</i>
Kings were created by the <i>Suffrages</i> of the <i>People.
Cornelius Tacitus</i>, in his Book <i>Demoribus Germanorum</i>,
proves plainly; and we have shown, that our <i>Franks</i> were a
<i>German</i> People: <i>Reges ex nobilitate, Duces ex virtute
sumunt</i>; "Their <i>Kings</i> (says he) they chuse from amongst
those that are most eminent for their <i>Nobility</i>; their
<i>Generals</i> out of those <i>that are Famous for their
Valour:"</i> Which Institution, [Footnote: 1574.] to this very day,
the <i>Germans, Danes, Sweeds and Polanders</i> do retain. They
<i>elect</i> their Kings in a <i>Great Council of the Nation</i>;
the Sons of whom have this privilege (as <i>Tacitus</i> has
recorded) to be preferr'd to other Candidates. I do not know
whether any thing cou'd ever have been devised more prudently, or
more proper for the Conversation of a Commonwealth, than this
Institution. For so <i>Plutarch</i>, in his Life of <i>Sylla</i>,
plainly advises. "Even (says he) as expert Hunters not only
endeavour to procure a Dog of a right good Breed, but a Dog that is
known to be a right good Dog himself; or a Horse descended
from a generous Sire, but a tryed good Horse himself:
Even so, those that constitute a Commonwealth, are much mistaken if
they have more regard to <i>kindred</i>, than to the
<i>qualification</i> of the Prince they are about to set over
them."</p>

<p>And that this was the Wisdom of our Predecessors in
constituting the <i>Francogallican Kingdom</i>, we may learn, First,
from the last Will and Testament of the Emperor <i>Charlemagn</i>,
publish'd by <i>Joannes Nauclerus</i> and <i>Henricus Mutius</i>; in which
there is this Clause&mdash;"And if any Son shall hereafter be
born to any of these, my three Sons, whom the People shall be
<i>willing to Elect</i> to succeed his Father in the Kingdom; My Will
is, that his Uncles do consent and suffer the Son of their
Brother to reign over that portion of the Kingdom which was
formerly his Father's." Secondly, What <i>Aimoinus, lib.</i> I.
<i>cap.</i> 4. says, of <i>Pharamond</i>, commonly counted the first King
of the <i>Franks</i>, in these Words.&mdash;"The <i>Franks electing</i>
for themselves a King, according to the custom of other Nations,
raised up <i>Pharamond</i> to the Regal Throne." And again, <i>lib.</i>
4.&mdash;"But the Franks took a certain <i>Clerk</i> or <i>Priest</i>
called <i>Daniel</i>; and as soon as his Hair was grown,
<i>establish'd</i> him in the Kingdom, calling him <i>Chilperic</i>." And
<i>lib.</i> 4. <i>cap.</i> 67.&mdash;"King <i>Pipin</i> being dead, his two Sons,
<i>Charles</i> and <i>Carlomannus</i>, were <i>elected Kings by the consent
of all the</i> Franks." And in another place&mdash;"As soon as
<i>Pipin</i> was dead, the <i>Franks</i> having appointed a solemn
<i>Convention, constituted</i> both his Sons Kings over them, upon
this foregoing condition, that they should divide the whole
Kingdom equally between them."&mdash; And again, after the Death
of one of the Brothers&mdash;"But <i>Charles</i>, after his Brother's
Decease, was <i>constituted</i> King by the <i>consent</i> of all the
Franks." Also, towards the end of his History of <i>Charles the
Great</i>, he says, "The Nobility of the <i>Franks</i> being solemnly
assembled from all parts of the Kingdom; he, in their presence,
called forth to him <i>Lewis</i> King of <i>Aquitain</i>, (the only one of
<i>Heldegardis's</i> Sons then living) and <i>by the advice and consent
of them all</i>, constituted him his Associate in the whole
Kingdom, and Heir of the Imperial Dignity." Thus much out of
<i>Aimoinus</i>.</p>

<p>Many Testimonies of the like nature we find in <i>Gregorius
Turen</i> whereof we shall cite only these few following, <i>lib.
2. cap. 12.</i>&mdash;"The <i>Franks</i> (says he) having <i>expelled
Childeric</i>; unanimously <i>elected Eudo</i> for their
King."&mdash;Also <i>lib. 4. cap. 51.</i>&mdash;"Then the
<i>Franks</i> (who once looked towards <i>Childebert</i> the Elder)
sent an Embassy to <i>Sigebert</i>, inviting him to leave
<i>Chilperic</i> and come to them, that they by <i>their own
Authority</i> might make him King."&mdash;And a little
after&mdash;"The whole Army was drawn up before him; and having set
him upon a Shield, <i>they appointed</i> him to be their
King."&mdash;And in another place&mdash;"<i>Sigebert</i> agreeing
to the <i>Franks</i> Proposals, was placed upon a Shield, according
to the Custom of that Nation, and proclaimed King; and so got the
Kingdom from his Bother <i>Chilperic</i>"&mdash;And presently
after&mdash;"The <i>Burgundians</i> and <i>Austrasians</i>
concluded a Peace with the <i>Franks</i>, and made
<i>Clotharius</i> King over them in all the three Kingdoms," Which
particular the <i>Abbot</i> of <i>Ursperg</i> confirms. "The
<i>Burgundians</i> (says he) and <i>Austrasians</i> having
struck up a Peace with the <i>Franks</i>, advanced
<i>Clotharius</i> to be King and sole Ruler of the whole
Kingdom."&mdash;And in another place&mdash;"The <i>Franks</i>
appointed one of his Brothers, called <i>Hilderic</i>, who was
already King of the <i>Austrasians</i>, to be also their King."</p>

<p>To this matter belongs what <i>Luitprandus Ticinensis</i>
writes, <i>lib. i. cap. 6</i>. "And when he was about to enter into
that <i>Francia</i> which is called <i>Roman</i>, (after having
cross'd the Countries of the <i>Burgundians</i>) several
Ambassadors of the <i>Franks</i> met him, acquainting him that they
were returning Home again; because being tired with long
expectation of his coming, and not able any longer to be without a
King, they had <i>unanimously</i> Chosen <i>Odo</i> or <i>Wido</i>, tho'
'tis reported the <i>Franks</i> did not take <i>Wido</i> upon this
occasion for their King, &amp;c."</p>

<p>But concerning this <i>Odo</i>, the Story is memorable which
<i>Sigibert</i> relates; from whence we may more clearly be
inform'd of the manner of their <i>rejecting</i> their King's <i>Son</i>, and
"<i>setting up another</i> in his stead." For (<i>sub anno</i> 890.) he says thus&mdash;
"But the <i>Franks</i> neglecting <i>Charles</i> the Son of
<i>Lewis the Stammerer</i>, a Boy scarce ten years old;
Elected, <i>Odo</i> for their King, who was Son of <i>Duke
Robert</i>, slain by the <i>Normans</i>." Also <i>Otto Frinsing,
Chronic. lib. 6. cap. 10</i>. "The <i>Western Franks</i> (says he)
with the consent of <i>Arnolphus</i>, chose for their King
<i>Odo</i> a valiant Man, and Son of <i>Robert</i>."&mdash;Also in
the <i>Appendix</i> to <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours</i>, lib. 15. cap. 30. "After the
Death of <i>Dagobert, Clodoveus</i> his Son obtain'd his Father's
Kingdom, being at that time very young, and all his <i>Leudes</i>
(that is, Subjects) <i>rais'd</i> him to the Throne, <i>in Villa
Masolano</i>."&mdash;Also <i>Sigebert</i>, in <i>chronic. anno</i>
987.&mdash;"<i>Lewis</i> King of the <i>Franks</i> being dead, the
<i>Franks</i> had a mind to transfer the Kingdom to <i>Charles</i>
the Brother of <i>Lotharius</i>; but whilst he spent too much time,
deliberating with his Council concerning that Affair, <i>Hugo</i>
acquires the Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i>, &amp;c." There are many
Testimonies, of the same Kind in <i>Ado</i>, viz. <i>anno</i>
686.&mdash;"<i>Clodoveus</i> the King dying, the <i>Franks</i>
elect <i>Clotarius</i> his Son for their King." And again,
&mdash;"<i>Clotarius</i> having reigned four Years, died, in whose
stead the Franks elected <i>Theodorick</i> his Brother&mdash;."
Again, <i>anno</i> 669. "The <i>Franks</i> establish'd in the
Kingdom a certain Clerk, called <i>Daniel</i>, having caused him to
quit his Tonsure and Orders, and name him <i>Chilperic</i>." And
again,&mdash;"The <i>Franks</i> appoint, as King over them,
<i>Theodoric</i> the Son of <i>Dagobert</i>"&mdash;. Also <i>Otto
Frising</i> chron. 6. cap. 13.&mdash;"<i>Otto</i> (says he) King of
the <i>Franks</i> being dead, <i>Charles</i> was created King by
unanimous Consent&mdash;." The Appendix to <i>Greg. Turon</i>.
<i>lib.</i> 11. <i>cap.</i> 101. says thus, "When <i>Theodoric</i>
was dead, the <i>Franks</i> elected <i>Clodoveus</i> his Son, who
was very young, to be their King." And <i>cap.</i> 106. "But the
<i>Franks</i> appoint one <i>Chilperick</i> to be their King." Also
<i>Godfrey</i> of <i>Viterbo</i>, <i>chron. part</i>. 17.
<i>cap.</i> 4.&mdash;"But <i>Pipin</i> in being elected by the
<i>Franks</i>, was declared King by Pope <i>Zacharias</i>, <i>they
having thrust their cowardly King</i> Hilderic <i>into a
Monastery</i>."</p>

<p>From these Proofs, and very many others like them, I think 'tis
most plain, that the Kings of <i>Francogallia</i> were made such
rather by the <i>Suffrages</i> and <i>Favour</i> of the
<i>People</i>, than by any <i>Hereditary Right</i>. Of which a farther
Argument may be the <i>Forms</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i> used by our
<i>Ancestors</i>, at the Inauguration of their <i>Kings</i>. For we
observe, the very same Custom was continued at the <i>Election</i>
of our Kings, which we told you before out of <i>Cornelius
Tacitus</i>, was formerly practised by the <i>Caninesates</i>, (the
<i>Franks</i> own Country-men) <i>viz.</i> that they set their
<i>Elected King</i> upon a <i>Shield</i>, and carried him on high
on Men's Shoulders. So did we; for whoever was chosen by the Votes
of the People, was set upon a Shield, and carried thrice round the
place of publick Meeting for <i>Election</i>, or round about the
Army on Men's Shoulders, all the People expressing their joy by
Acclamations, and clapping of Hands. <i>Greg. Turen. lib.</i> 2.
where he makes mention of King <i>Clodoveus's</i>
Election,&mdash;"But they (says he) as soon as they heard these
things, applauding him both with their Hands and Tongues, and
hoisting him on a Shield, <i>appointed</i> him to be their King&mdash;."
Also <i>lib.</i> 7. <i>cap.</i> 10. where he speaks of
<i>Gondebaldus</i>,&mdash;"And there (says he) placing their King
upon a <i>Shield</i>, they lifted him up; but 'tis reported, that as they
were carrying him round the third time, he fell down; so that he
was scarcely kept from tumbling to the very Ground by those that
stood about him." Of which Accident <i>Aimoinus, lib. 3. cap.
6.</i> gives us this Account,&mdash;"They called forth <i>Gondebaldus</i>,
and according to the Custom of the ancient <i>Franks</i>,
proclaimed him their King, and hoisted him on a Shield; and as they
were carrying him the third time round the whole Army, of a sudden
they fell down with him, and could scarce get him up again from the
Ground&mdash;." The like says <i>Ado. Vien.</i> &AElig;tat.
6.&mdash;<i>"Sigebertus</i> consenting to the <i>Franks</i>, was
placed upon a Shield, according to the <i>Custom of that
Nation</i>, and proclaimed King": And peradventure from hence arose
that Form among those Writers, who treat of the Creation of a
King;&mdash;<i>In Regem elevatus est.</i></p>

<p>But now we come to the third Part of this Controversy, in order
to understand, how great the <i>Right and Power of the People</i>
was, both in <i>making</i> and <i>continuing</i> their Kings. And I
think it is plainly prov'd from all our Annals, that the
<i>highest Power</i> of <i>abdicating</i> their <i>Kings</i>, was
lodged in the <i>People</i>. The very first that was created King
of <i>Francogallia</i>, is a remarkable instance of his Power. For
when the People had found him out to be a profligate lewd Person,
wasting his time in Adulteries and Whoredoms, they removed him from
his Dignity by universal Consent, and constrain'd him to depart out
of the Territories of <i>France</i>: and this was done, as our
Annals testify, in the Year of Christ 469. Nay, even <i>Eudo</i>, whom
they had placed in his stead, abusing his Power thro' excessive
Pride and Cruelty, was with the like Severity <i>turned out</i>.
Which Fact we find attested by <i>Gregory of Tours, lib. 2. cap.
12. Aimoinus, lib. 1. cap. 7. Godfrey of Viterbo, part. 17. cap. 1.
Sigibertus, sub annis 461, &amp; 469. "Childeric</i> (says
<i>Gregorius</i>) being dissolved in Luxury, when he was King of
the <i>Franks</i>, and beginning to deflower their Daughters, was
by his Subjects <i>cast out of the Throne with Indignation</i>;
whereupon he finding they had a Design to kill him, fled into
<i>Thoringia</i>." But the <i>Abbot of Ursperg</i> says, "the
People were unwilling to kill him, but contented themselves with
having <i>turn'd him out, because he was a dissolute Man</i>, and a
Debaucher of his Subjects Daughters&mdash;." <i>Sigibertus</i>
says,&mdash;"<i>Hilderick</i> behaving himself insolently and
luxuriously, the <i>Franks thrust him out of the Throne</i>, and
made <i>&AElig;gidius</i> their King."</p>

<p>And this most glorious and famous Deed of our Ancestors,
deserves the more diligently to be remark'd, for having been done
at the very Beginning, and as it were, the Infancy of that Kingdom;
as if it had been a Denunciation, and Declaration, that the Kings
of <i>Francogallia</i> were made such, upon certain <i>known terms
and Conditions</i>; and were <i>not Tyrants</i> with <i>absolute
unlimited</i> and <i>arbitrary</i> Power.</p>

<p>Their Successors also, keeping up the same Custom, in the Year
of <i>Christ</i> 679, forced <i>Childeric</i>, their Eleventh King,
to <i>Abdicate</i>, because he had behaved himself insolently and
wickedly in his Government. And he having formerly caused a certain
Nobleman, called <i>Bodilo</i>, to be tied to a Stake and whipp'd,
without bringing him to a Tryal, was a few Days after slain by the
same <i>Bodilo</i>. Our Authors are <i>Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 44.
Trithemius, anno 678.</i> and <i>Sigebertus, anno 667</i>.</p>

<p>The Severity of our Ancestors appear'd in the same Manner a
little while after, in the Instance of their 12th King
<i>Theodoric</i>; who being a wicked and covetous Prince, "the
<i>Franks</i> (says <i>Aimoinus</i>) <i>rose up against him</i>,
and <i>cast him out of the Kingdom</i>, cutting off his hair by
<i>force</i>," lib. 4. cap. 44.&mdash;<i>Ado</i>, &AElig;tat. 6.
anno 696. but <i>Sigebertus</i> sub anno 667. imputes a great many
of his Crimes to <i>Ebroinus</i> his Favourite and chief General.
[Footnote: <i>Pr&aelig;fectus Regius.</i>] "King <i>Theodorick</i>"
(says he) "was <i>deposed</i> by the <i>Franks</i>, because of the
Insolence of <i>Ebroinus</i>, and his Brother <i>Hilderick</i> was
with unanimous Consent <i>chosen</i> King." And <i>Ado</i> says,
"The <i>Franks</i> cast <i>Theodorick</i> out of the Kingdom,
shaved <i>Ebroinus</i> in the Monastery of <i>Lexovium</i>, and
afterwards raised <i>Childerick</i> to be King over them." Also the
Appendix to <i>Greg. of Tours, lib. II. cap. 64.</i>&mdash;"The
<i>Franks</i> rise up in <i>Arms</i> against <i>Theodorick, cast
him out</i> of the Kingdom, and cut off his Hair: They shaved also
<i>Ebroinus."</i></p>

<p>The like Virtue our Ancestors exerted in the Case of
<i>Chilperick</i> their 18th King, whom they <i>forced to abdicate
the Kingdom</i>, [Footnote: <i>Regno se abdicare coegerunt.</i>]
and made him a Monk, judging him unworthy to sit at the Helm of so
great an Empire, [Footnote: <i>Propter inertiam.</i>] <i>by reason
of his Sloth</i>. Whereof <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 4. cap. 61.
<i>Sigibertus</i> and <i>Trithemius</i>, anno 750. and
<i>Godfrey</i>, Chronic. part. 17. cap. 4. are our Witnesses.</p>

<p>Again, a sixth Example of the like Severity is extant in
<i>Charles the Gross</i> their 25th King; who for the like
<i>Cowardise</i>, and because he had granted away part of
<i>France</i> to the <i>Normans, suffering his Kingdom to be
dismembred</i>, was [Footnote: <i>Ab optimatibus Regni
repudiatas.</i>] <i>rejected and turn'd out</i> by the
<i>Nobility</i> and <i>Gentry</i> of the Kingdom, as
<i>Sigebertus</i> tells us <i>anno 890</i>. Which same thing
<i>Godfridus</i> records, <i>part. 17</i>. But more at large
<i>Otto Frising, chron. 6. cap. 9.</i> where he adds this memorable
Passage,&mdash;"This Man (says he) who next to <i>Charles the
Great</i>, had been the King of greatest Power and Authority of all
the Kings of the Franks, was in a short time reduced to so low a
Condition, that he wanted Bread to eat, and miserably begged a
small Allowance from <i>Arnolphus</i>, who was <i>chosen</i> King
in his stead, and thankfully accepted of a poor Pension: From
whence we may observe the uncertain and miserable State of all
Human Greatness; that he who had govern'd all the <i>Eastern</i>
and <i>Western</i> Kingdoms, together with the <i>Roman</i> Empire,
shou'd at last be brought down to such a Degree of Poverty, as to
want even Bread." A Seventh Instance is <i>Odo</i> the 26th King,
who after he had been elected King in the Room of <i>Charles</i>
the Son of <i>Lewis</i> the <i>Stammerer</i>, was in the 4th Year
of his Reign, by the <i>Franks, banish'd</i> into <i>Aquitain</i>,
and commanded to abide there; they replacing in his stead the same
<i>Charles</i> the Son of <i>Lewis</i>. Which Fact is recorded by
<i>Sigebertus</i>, sub anno 894. <i>Aimoinus</i> lib. 5. cap. 42.
and <i>Godfridus</i> part. 17.</p>

<p>We must add to this Number <i>Charles</i> the 27th King,
sirnamed (because of his <i>Dullness</i>) [Footnote: <i>Propter
Stuporem ingenii</i>.] <i>Charles</i> the <i>Simple</i>: Who having
thro' his Folly suffer'd his Kingdom to run to Decay, and lost
<i>Lorrain</i> (which he had before recover'd) was <i>taken and
cast into Prison</i>, and <i>Rodolphus</i> was <i>chosen</i> in his
place, as <i>Aimoinus, lib. 5. cap. 42.</i> and <i>Sigebertus, anno

<h2><a name="CHAP_VII" id="CHAP_VII" />CHAP. VII.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>What Rule was observ'd concerning the Inheritance
of the deceased King, when he left more Children than one.</i></p>

<p>All that we have above said, tends to prove, that the Kingdom of
<i>Francogallia</i> in old times, did not descend to the Children
by <i>Right of Inheritance</i> (as a private Patrimony does); but
was wont to be bestow'd by the <i>Choice and publick Suffrages of
the People</i>: So that now there is the less Room left for the
Question,&mdash;What Rule was observed in Relation to the Children
of the deceased King, when he left more than one behind him. For
since the Supreme Power nor only of <i>Creating</i>, but also of
<i>dethroning</i> their Kings, was lodged in the <i>Convention</i>
of the <i>People</i>, and <i>Publick Council</i> of the Nation; it
necessarily follows, that the <i>ordering</i> the <i>Succession</i>
(whether they should give it entirely to one, or divide it) was
likewise in the <i>People</i>. Altho' in this place another
Question may arise, <i>viz.</i> supposing the People shou'd
<i>reject</i> the Son of their King, and <i>elect</i> a Stranger,
whether any thing should be allowed to the first to maintain his
Dignity? For the Solution, of which 'tis to be understood, that
Lawyers reckon four Kinds of such Goods, as may be properly said to
be under the King's [Footnote: <i>In Regis ditione.</i>]
Governance; <i>viz.</i> the Goods of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, the Goods of
the <i>Exchequer</i>; the Goods of the <i>Publick</i>, and
<i>Private</i> Goods. The Goods of <i>C&aelig;sar</i> are such as belong
to the <i>Patrimony</i> of every Prince, not as he is <i>King</i>,
but as he is Ludovicus, or <i>Lotharius</i>, or <i>Dagobertus</i>.
Now this Patrimony is called by the <i>Gallican</i> Institutions,
<i>The King's Domain</i>; which cannot be alien'd, but by the
Consent of the <i>publick Council</i> of the Nation, as we shall
make it appear hereafter, when we come to treat of the Authority of
that <i>Council</i>. The Goods of the <i>Exchequer</i> are such as
are given by the <i>People</i>, partly to defend the King's
Dignity, and partly appropriated to the Uses and Exigencies of the
<i>Commonwealth</i>. The Goods of the <i>Publick</i> (as the
Lawyers call them) are such as inseparably belong to the
<i>Kingdom</i> and <i>Commonwealth</i>. The <i>private</i> Goods
are reckon'd to be such Estate, Goods and Fortune, as are esteemed
to belong to every Father of a Family. Therefore upon the Death of
any King, if the Kingdom be conferr'd on a Stranger, the
<i>Patrimonial</i> Estate, as Lawyers call it, (being what was not
in the King's Power to alienate) shall descend by Inheritance to
his Children: But that which belongs to the <i>Kingdom</i> and
<i>Commonwealth</i>, must necessarily go to him who is chosen King,
because it is part of the <i>Kingdom</i>. Altho' it may be
reasonable, that Dukedoms, Counties, and such like (by Consent of
the <i>publick Convention</i> of the People) may be assigned to
such Children for the Maintenance of their Quality; as <i>Otto
Frising</i>, Chron. 5. cap. 9. and <i>Godfrey of Viterbo</i>, tell
us, That <i>Dagobert</i> Son of <i>Lotharius</i> being made King,
assigned certain Towns and Villages near the <i>Loire</i>, to his
Brother <i>Heribert</i> for his Maintenance. Which <i>Aimoinus</i>
confirms, <i>lib.</i> 4. cap. 17. and further adds, that he made a
Bargain with him, to live as a private Person, and to expect no
more of his Father's Kingdom. Also in his 61. <i>chap.</i> where he
speaks of King <i>Pipin</i>, "He bestowed (says he) some Counties
on his Brother <i>Grison</i>, according to the <i>Order</i> of the
Twelve Peers." And to this belongs what <i>Greg. Turon.</i> writes,
<i>lib. 7. cap. 32.</i>&mdash;"<i>Gondobaldus</i> sent two
Ambassadors to the King with consecrated Rods in their hands, (that
no Violence might be offer'd them by any body, according to the
Rites of the <i>Franks</i>) who spoke these Words to the King,
<i>Gondobaldus</i> says, he is a Son of King <i>Clotharius</i>, and
has sent us to claim a due Portion of his Kingdom."</p>

<p>But to return to the Question, as far as it relates to the
Succession of the Kingdom; I can find out no certain Rule or Law in
<i>Francogallia</i> touching that Matter; because (as I said
before) the Kingdom was not hereditary. 'Tis true, that in many
<i>Noble Patrimonies</i> there was what we call <i>Fiefs</i>,
Feuda; as <i>Otto Frising. lib. 2. cap. 29.</i> observes, "'Tis the
Custom (says he) in <i>Burgundy</i>, which is also in most of the
other Provinces of <i>France</i>, that the Authority of the
Paternal Inheritance always falls to the Elder Brother, and his
Children, whether Male or Female; the others looking on him as
their Lord&mdash;." And that the same was practised among the whole
Nation of the <i>Franks, Petrus de Vincis</i>, lib. epist. 6.
epist. 25. and in other Places of his Writings, sets forth at
large. But in the Succession of the Kingdom a different Rule was
observ'd. For our Records do testify, that in old times the Kingdom
of <i>Francogallia</i>, upon the Death of the King, was very often,
not bestowed by the People on any one of his Sons, but divided into
convenient Parcels, and a part assigned to each of them. Therefore
when <i>Clodoveus</i> the 2d King dyed, <i>anno</i> 515. who left
four Sons, <i>Theodorick, Clodoveus, Childebert</i>, and
<i>Clotharius</i>, we find the Kingdom was thus divided among them;
<i>Theodorick</i> had the Kingdom of <i>Metz</i> for his Share,
<i>Clodoveus</i> that of <i>Orleans, Clotharius</i> that of
<i>Soissons</i>, and <i>Childebertus</i> that of <i>Paris</i>, as
'tis recorded by <i>Agathius</i>, lib. hist. 1. <i>Greg. Taron.</i>
lib. 3. cap. 1. <i>Aimoinus</i> lib. 2. cap. 1. <i>Rhegino</i> sub
anno 421.</p>

<p>Again, after the Death of <i>Clotharius</i> the 4th King, the
Kingdom was divided among his four Sons. So that <i>Cherebertus</i>
had that of <i>Paris: Guntranus, Orleans: Chilpericus,
Soissons:</i> and <i>Sigebertus</i> that of <i>Rheims</i>&mdash;,
Greg. <i>lib. 4. cap. 22.</i> Aimoinus <i>lib. 3. cap. 1.</i>
Rhegino <i>sub anno</i> 498.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <i>Otto Frising.</i> chron. 5. cap. 9. and
<i>God. Viterb.</i> tell us, That about the Year 630, when
<i>Lotharius</i> the 7th King died, <i>Dagobertus</i> his Son
reigned <i>singly</i> in <i>France</i>, and assigned to his Brother
<i>Heribert</i> some Cities and Villages on the River <i>Loire</i>,
for his Maintenance. For from <i>Clodoveus</i>'s Time till now, the
Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i> was confusedly subdivided among the
Sons, and the Sons Sons, each of which reigned over the part
allotted him.&mdash;"The Extent of the Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i>
reaching now from <i>Spain</i>, as far as to <i>Hungary:
Dagobert</i> being sole King of all the <i>Franks</i>, gave Laws to
the <i>Bavarians</i>." So says <i>Godefridus</i>, not without good
Grounds, as many wise Men have thought. For, as <i>Justin</i> tells
us, <i>lib. 21.</i> "That Kingdom will be much more potent, which
remains under the Domination of one Person, than when 'tis divided
among many Brothers."</p>

<p>But after some Years, when the Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i> was
excessively enlarged on all Sides, and King <i>Pipin</i> was dead,
the <i>General Council</i> of the <i>Gauls</i> changed this Method
again. Which serves to confirm what we said before; <i>viz.</i>
That the <i>whole Power</i>, relating to that Matter, was lodged in
that <i>Council</i>. For <i>Eguinarthus</i>, in his Life of
<i>Charlemagn</i>, writes thus, "&mdash;After King <i>Pipin'</i>s
Death, the <i>Franks</i> having assembled themselves in a <i>solemn
general Convention</i>, did there <i>appoint</i> both his Sons to
be their Kings, upon this Condition, that they shou'd equally
divide the whole body of the Kingdom between them: And that
<i>Charles</i> shou'd reign over that part of it, which their
Father <i>Pipin</i> enjoy'd; and <i>Carloman</i> over the other
Part which their <i>Uncle</i> held."</p>

<p>Also the <i>Abbot of Ursperg</i> says,&mdash;"When <i>Pipin</i> was
dead, his two Sons <i>Charles</i> and <i>Carloman</i>, by the
<i>Consent of all the Franks</i>, were created Kings, upon
Condition, that they shou'd divide the whole body of the Kingdom
equally between them.&mdash;" The same Method in dividing the
Kingdom, was practised after the Death of <i>Charlemagn</i>, as
'tis manifest by his last Will and Testament, recorded by
<i>Joannes Nauclerus</i>, and <i>Eguinarthus</i>'s History of his
Life. Wherein we find almost all <i>Europe</i> so divided among his
three Sons, that nothing was assigned either as a Portion or Dower,
to his Daughters; but the marrying and providing for them was
entirely trusted to the Care and Prudence of their Brothers.
<i>Otto Frisingensis</i>, chron. 6. cap. 6. and <i>Rhegino</i> in
chron. anno 877. assure us, that the same Manner of dividing the Kingdom
was practis'd in <i>East-France</i>, after the Death of <i>King
Lewis the Stammerer</i>, in 874. Again, some Years after,
<i>anno</i> 880. after King <i>Lewis</i> the 23d King's Death, the
very same way of dividing the Kingdom was made use of; which
however we are to observe, was <i>not in</i> the <i>Power</i> and
<i>Arbitriment</i> of <i>the Kings themselves</i>; but done by the
<i>Authority</i> of the <i>Publick Council</i>, as we may easily
collect from these Words of <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 5. cap. 40. "The
Sons (says he) of <i>Lewis</i>, late King of the <i>Franks</i>, met
at <i>Amiens</i>, and divided their Father's Kingdom between them,
<i>according to the Direction of their faithful Subjects</i>."</p>

<p>From all which Arguments 'tis very plain, that anciently there
was no certain Law or Right of <i>Francogallia</i> touching this
Matter; but the <i>whole Power of disposing</i> of it was lodged in
the <i>Publick Council</i> of the Nation. Indeed afterwards in the
Reign of <i>Philip</i> the 3d, (the 41st King) it was ordained,
that certain Lordships might be set out and assigned to younger
Brothers: But even of this Law there were various Interpretations,
and many Controversies arose concerning Daughters; so that we can
deliver nothing for certain in this Affair; only thus much we may
truly say, That <i>if the Ancient Institution of our Ancestors
ought to be our Rule, the Determination of this whole Matter must
be left to the Publick General Council of the Nation:</i> that
according to the Number of Children, some particular Lordships or
Territories, may <i>(by its Authority)</i> be assigned for their
Maintenance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VIII" id="CHAP_VIII" />CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> Salick Law, <i>and what Right</i>
Women <i>had in the King's their Father's Inheritance</i>.</p>

<p>Because we have undertaken to give an Account of the <i>Law</i>
and <i>Right</i> of <i>Regal Inheritance</i>, we must not omit
making Mention of the <i>Salick Law</i>; which is both daily
discours'd of by our Countrymen, and in the Memory of our
Forefathers serv'd to appease a great and dangerous Contention,
which arose touching the Succession to the Crown. For when
(<i>Anno</i> 1328.) <i>Charles the Fair</i>, Son of <i>Philip the
Fair</i>, died, leaving his Wife with Child of a Daughter, (which
some Months after was born) <i>Edward King of England</i> (Son of
<i>Isabella</i>, the Daughter of <i>Philip the fair</i>, and Sister
to <i>Charles</i> lately dead) claimed the Inheritance of his
Grandfather's Kingdom as his Right. But <i>Philip of Valois</i>,
Cousin germain by the Father's Side to the deceased King, standing
up, alledged that there was an ancient Regal Law, called the
<i>Salick Law</i>, by which <i>all Women</i> were excluded from the
Inheritance of the Crown. Now this Law both <i>Gaguinus</i> and
other Writers of like Stamp tell us, was written by
<i>Pharamond</i>; and he calls it a most famous Law, even to his
Time. For in his Life of <i>Philip of Valois</i>; "The
<i>Salick</i> Law (says he) was a Bar to <i>Edward</i>'s Title;
which Law being first given by <i>Pharamond</i> to the
<i>Franks</i>, has been religiously observed, even to those Days.
By that Law, only the Heirs Male of our Kings are capable of
governing the Kingdom, and no Females can be admitted to that
Dignity. The Words of that Law are these: <i>Nulla hereditatis
portio de terr&acirc; Salic&acirc; ad mulierem venito; Let no Part
of the Inheritance of</i> Salick <i>Land come to a Woman</i>. Now (says
<i>Gaguinus</i>) the <i>French</i> Lawyers call <i>Salick</i> Land,
such as belongs only to the King, and is different from the
<i>Alodial</i> which concerns the Subjects; to whom, by that Law,
is granted a free Dominion of any thing, not excluding the Princely
Authority." And to the same Purpose, not only almost all the
<i>Francogallican Historians</i>, but even all the <i>Lawyers</i>
and <i>Pettifoggers</i> have wrote to this Day, as <i>Paponius</i>
testifies, <i>Arrest.</i> lib. 4. cap. 1. So that now the mistake
has prevailed so far, as to have obtain'd the Force of a Law. To
explain this, it must be remembred (which we formerly gave an
Account of) that the <i>Franks</i> had two Seats of their Empire,
and two Kingdoms; One in <i>France</i>, which remains to this Day;
The other beyond the <i>Rhine</i>, near the River <i>Sala</i>; from
whence they were called <i>Salii</i>, and <i>Salici Franci</i>
(joyning the two Names together) but for the most part briefly
<i>Salici</i>; the Kingdom of these last, and even their very Name
is in a Manner extinct. <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> makes mention
in his History (as we told you before) of these <i>Salii</i>, and
shews, that they are called the <i>Eastern Franks</i>, as the
others were called the <i>Western</i>. Now as there were two
Kingdoms of the <i>Franks</i>, so they had different Laws: those
that belonged to the <i>Salii</i>, were called <i>Salick</i>; those
that belonged to the <i>Francogalli</i>, were called <i>French.
Eguinarthus</i> in his Life of <i>Charles</i> the Great says
thus:&mdash;"After he had assumed the Imperial Title, finding that
his Peoples Laws were in many Things deficient, (<i>for the</i>
Franks <i>have two Laws very different from each other in many
Cases</i>,) he thought of adding such as were wanting."&mdash;The
Author of the Preface to the <i>Salick</i> Law has this
Passage.&mdash;"The renowned Nation of the <i>Franks</i>, before
it was converted to the Catholick Faith, enacted the <i>Salick</i>
Law by the Great Men of the Nation, who at that Time were their
Governors; and from among a great many, four Persons were chosen;
<i>Wisogast, Arbogast, Salogast</i>, and <i>Windogast</i>; who,
during three Conventions [<i>tres mallos</i>] carefully perusing
all Causes from their Original, gave their Judgment and Decree of
every one of them in this Manner, &amp;c.&mdash;" <i>Sigebertus</i>
in Chron. anni 422. &amp; <i>Otto Frising</i>, lib. 4. cap. penult.
make use of almost the same Words. "From that time (say they) the
Laws recommended to them by <i>Wisigastaldus</i> and
<i>Salogastus</i>, began to be in Force. By this <i>Salogastus</i>,
they tell us, that Law was invented, which from his Name is to this
Day called the <i>Salick</i> Law; and the most noble of the
<i>Franks</i>, called <i>Salici</i>, observe it at this
time."&mdash;Thus say the old Chronographers. By which we may
refute the Error of such as derive the <i>Salick</i> Law,
<i>&agrave; Sale</i>, that is, <i>Prudence</i>; or what is called
corruptly <i>Lex Salica</i>, instead of <i>Gallica</i>; than which
nothing can be more absurd. But much greater Errors spring from the
same Fountain: First, That People are so far imposed upon by those
Authors, as to believe the <i>Salick</i> Law had reference to the
<i>Publick Right</i> of the <i>Commonwealth</i> and the <i>Government</i>,
also to the <i>Hereditary Succession</i> of the Kingdom. Now the
very Records or Tables of this <i>Salick</i> Law were not many
Years ago found and brought to Light; from whose Inscription it
appears, that they were first written and publish'd about
<i>Pharamond'</i>s time: Besides, that all the Heads and Articles,
both of the <i>Salick</i> and <i>French</i> Laws, were
Constitutions relating only to <i>private Right</i> between Man and
Man, and meddled not with the <i>Publick</i> Right of the Kingdom
or Commonwealth: among the rest, one Chapter, <i>tit. 62.</i> has
this in it.&mdash;"Of the <i>Salick</i> Land, no Part or Portion of
Inheritance passes to a Female; but this falls to the Male
Off-spring; that is, the Sons shall succeed to the Inheritance: But
where a Dispute shall arise (after a long Course of Time) among the
Grandsons and great Grandsons, <i>de alode terr&aelig;;</i> [Footnote:
<i>Allodium</i> is the contrary to <i>Feudum, Gothick</i> words,
for which 'tis difficult to find proper <i>English</i>.] let it be
divided, <i>Non per stirpes sed per capita."</i> The like Law,
<i>Extat apud</i> Ripuarios, <i>tit.</i> 58. <i>Item apud</i>
Anglos, <i>tit.</i> 7. Where they are so far from enacting any
thing relating to the Inheritances of Kingdoms, that they do not so
much as affect <i>Feudal</i> Successions, but only belong to
<i>Allodial</i>; altho' a Portion was assigned to Women out of
those <i>Allodial</i> Lands. Which Way soever this Matter may be,
'tis manifest in the first Place, that altho' no Article, either of
the <i>Frank</i> or <i>Salick</i> Law were extant, which debars
Women from the Inheritance of the Crown; yet the Customs and
Institutions of a Nation, preserv'd inviolate by universal Consent,
during so many Ages, obtain the Force of a written Law: For tho'
<i>Childeric</i>, the Third King, left two Daughters behind him at
his Death, the Kingdom was given to his Brother <i>Lotharius</i>,
and his Daughters excluded. Again, after the Death of
<i>Cherebert</i> the 5th King, who left three Daughters; the
Succession devolv'd upon his Brother <i>Sigebert</i>. Also when
<i>Gontrannus</i> King of <i>Burgundy</i> and <i>Orleans</i> died,
the Kingdom was conferr'd on his Brother <i>Sigebert</i>, not on
his Daughter <i>Clotilda</i>. Lastly, <i>Philip</i> of
<i>Valois's</i> Advocates might with greater Caution, as well as
Efficacy, have argued for him out of the <i>Feudal</i> Law, by
which all Inheritances of <i>Fiefs</i> descend to the Male Issue
only, and not to the Female, who are not admitted to them. And when
there happens a Want of Heirs Males in that Line or Branch wherein
the Fief is lodged, then the <i>Feudum</i> or <i>Fief</i> returns
back to the other Stock or Branch: which was the very Case at that
Time. But such Fiefs as thro' a Depravation of the Law, are
convey'd down to Women, cannot properly be called <i>Feuda</i>, but
<i>Feudastra</i>, as in other of our Writings we have made it
appear.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IX" id="CHAP_IX" />CHAP. IX.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Right of Wearing a large Head of Hair
peculiar to the Royal Family</i>.</p>

<p>It will not be amiss in this Place to give some Account of a
Custom of our Ancestors, relating to the Hair worn by the Royal
Family: For 'tis recorded, that our Forefathers had a particular
Law concerning it; <i>viz</i>. That such as were chosen Kings by
the People, or were of the Regal Family, shou'd preserve their
Hair, and wear it parted from the Forehead, on both Sides the Head,
and anointed with sweet Oyl, as an Ornament and peculiar Mark of
their being of the Royal Family; whilst all other Persons, how
nobly born soever, had no right to wear a large Head of Hair; but
were obliged to go with their Heads shorn or shaved, upon the
Account (as 'tis probable) that they shou'd be more ready and
expedite in their continual military Exercises, as the <i>Roman</i>
Histories tell us of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, and several others.
<i>Aimoinus</i> lib. 1 cap. 4. says&mdash;"The <i>Franks</i>
chusing for themselves a King, according to the Custom of other
Nations, raised, <i>Pharamond</i> to the Throne, to whom succeeded
his Son Clodio crinitus; For at that Time the Kings of the
<i>Franks</i> wore large Heads of Hair. Also lib. 3. cap. 61.
<i>Gundoaldus</i> being brought up by his Mother after the regal
Manner, wore a long Head of Hair, according to the Custom of the
ancient Kings of the <i>Franks</i>." In like Manner
<i>Agathius</i>, lib. de Bell. Goth. I. where he speaks of
<i>Clodoveus</i>, one of our Kings, who was taken in Battel by the
the <i>Burgundians</i>, (he calls him <i>Clodamirus</i>). "As soon
(says he) as his Horse had thrown him, the <i>Burgundians</i>
espying his large Head of Hair, which fell back over his Shoulders,
presently knew him to be the Enemy's <i>General</i>; for 'tis not
lawful for the Kings of the <i>Franks</i> to cut off their Hair,
but even from their Childhood they remain untrimm'd, and always
keep a large Head of Hair hanging low down upon their Backs." And
we have many Instances that it was our Ancestors Custom, whenever
they either deprived any one of the Crown, or took away all Hopes
of obtaining the Kingdom, to cut off his Head of Hair.
<i>Aimoinus</i> in the same Place&mdash;"He earnestly beholding
him, commanded his Hair to be cut off, denying him to be his
Son.&mdash;Also&mdash;Having caused his Hair to be cut off a second
Time, he put him in Prison at <i>Cologne</i>; from whence making his
Escape, he fled to <i>Narses</i>, and suffer'd his Hair to grow
again, &amp;c." Which Story <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours</i>, lib. 6.
cap. 24. likewise records. Also <i>cap.</i> 44. where he speaks of
King <i>Theodorick</i>.&mdash;"The Franks (says he) rose up in Arms
against him, and cast him out of the Kingdom, and cut off his Head
of Hair by Force." But there is a very remarkable, or rather
horrible Story related by <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours</i>,
concerning <i>Crotilda</i>, the Queen Mother; who chose rather to
have the Heads of her two Grandsons cut off than their Hair. 'Tis
in his 3d Book, <i>cap.</i> 18.&mdash;"Our Mother (says the King to
his Brother) has kept our Brother's Sons with her, and intends to
advance them to the Throne; we must concert what Measures ought to
be taken in this Affair; whether we shall order their Hair to be
cut off, and to reduce them to the State of common Subjects; or
whether we shall cause them to be put to Death, and afterwards
divide the Kingdom between us: Then they sent <i>Archadius</i> with
a Pair of Scissars in one Hand, and a naked Sword in t'other to the
Queen; who approaching her, showed them both to her, and said, Your
Sons, most Glorious Queen, have sent me to know your Pleasure, what
Destiny you are pleased to allot to these two Youths; whether by
suffering their Hair to be cut off, you will have them to live; or
whether you had rather have both their Throats cut. Whereupon She
chose rather to see them both kill'd, than to have their Hair cut
off." I further observe, that it was the Fashion when our Kings
went to single Combat, to have their long Hair tied up in a large
Knot a-top of their Helmets like a Crest; and that was their
Cognizance or Mark in all their Fights. Therefore <i>Aimoinus</i>,
lib. 4. cap. 18. where he speaks of the dreadful Combat between
King <i>Dagobert</i> and <i>Bertoaldus</i>, Duke of the
<i>Saxons:</i> "The King (says he) having his Hair, together with a
Part of his Helmet, cut off with a Blow of a Sword on his Head,
sent them by his Esquire to his Father, desiring him to hasten to
his Assistance."</p>

<p>Now when I consider what might be the Reasons of this
Institution, I can find none but this. That since it had been the
ancient Custom of the <i>Gauls</i> and <i>Franks</i> to wear their
Hair long (as it was also of the <i>Sicambri</i>, and of most
others in those Parts) our Ancestors thought fit to continue, and
in Process of Time to appropriate this Ornament, and Mark of
Distinction to the Regal Family. No Person, tho' but indifferently
learn'd, needs any Proof that the <i>Gauls</i> wore their Hair
long, especially when he calls to mind that of the Poet
<i>Claudian</i>, ex lib. in Ruffin. 2.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Inde truces flavo comitantur vertice</i> Galli</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Quos</i> Rhodanus <i>velox</i>, Araris <i>quos tardior
ambit</i>,</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Et quos nascentes explorat gurgite</i> Rhenus.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now that the <i>Franks</i> did so too, whom we have shewn to be
descended from the <i>Chauci</i> or <i>Chaiici</i>, that single
Passage of the Poet <i>Lucan</i> is sufficient to confirm.</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="i0"><i>Opposui, petitis</i> Roman, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which being so, we may easily comprehend the Reason why
Strangers, who were ill affected towards our Nation, contumeliously
called our Kings, who wore so great a Head of Hair, <i>Reges
setatos, bristled Kings</i>; and not only so, but (tho' Bristles
and long Hair be common to Lyons, Horses and Swine, all which are
therefore called <i>Setosi</i>, or <i>Setigeri</i>) they stretched
the Contumely so far, as to say, they had Hogs Bristles. From

they might have been called
&tau;&rho;&iota;&chi;&omicron;&chi;&#940;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;,
as being remarkable for their large Heads of Hair.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_X" id="CHAP_X" />CHAP. X.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>The Form and Constitution of the</i>
Francogallican <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>These Things being thus briefly premised, we think it proper now
to set forth in what Manner the Kingdom of <i>Francogallia</i> was
constituted. And we have already made it plain, that the
<i>People</i> reserv'd to themselves all the Power not only of
<i>Creating</i>, but also of <i>Abdicating</i> their <i>Kings</i>.
Which Form of Government 'tis manifest our Ancestors had; before
they were brought under by the <i>Romans</i>, "So that <i>the
People</i> (as <i>C&aelig;sar</i> tells us) <i>had no less authority and
Power over their Kings, than the Kings had over the People</i>.
Populus non minus in Regem, quam rex in populum imperii ac
Potestatis retinet." Altho' 'tis probable the <i>Franks</i> did not
derive this Constitution of their Commonwealth from the
<i>Gauls</i>; but from their Countrymen, the <i>Germans</i>; of
whom <i>Tacitus</i>, lib. de mor. <i>Germ</i>. says,&mdash;"Regibus
non est infinita aut libera Potestas. Their <i>Kings</i> have not
an <i>Arbitrary</i> or <i>Unlimited Power</i>." Now 'tis manifest,
that no Form of Government is more remote from Tyranny, than this:
for not one of the three distinguishing Marks, or Characteristicks
of <i>Tyranny</i>, which the old Philosophers make mention of, can
be found in the Form and Constitution of our Government. First, as
to a forced Obedience; <i>i. e.</i> that a King shou'd rule over a
People against their Wills; we have shewn you already, that the
<i>Supreme Power</i>, both of <i>Electing</i> and <i>Abdicating</i>
their <i>Kings</i>, was in the <i>People</i>. Secondly, as to a
Life-guard composed of Foreigners, (which they reckon the Second
Mark of <i>Tyranny</i>); so far were our <i>Francogallian</i> Kings
from making use of Mercenary Strangers for their Guards, that they
had not so much as their own Countrymen and Citizens, for that
Purpose; but placed their whole Trust and Confidence in the Love
and Fidelity of their Subjects; which they thought a sufficient
Guard.</p>

<p>As an Argument of this, we may observe what <i>Gregory of
Tours</i> writes, lib. 7. cap. 18. and <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 3.
cap. 63.&mdash;"King <i>Gontrannus</i> being inform'd by an
ordinary Fellow at <i>Paris</i>, that <i>Faraulphus</i> lay in Wait
for him, presently began to secure his Person by Guards and
Weapons; so that he went no whither (not even to the Holy Places)
without being surrounded with armed Men and Soldiers." We have at
present a very famous History extant of St. <i>Lewis</i>, written
by that excellent Person <i>Joannes Jonvill&aelig;us</i>, who lived very
familiarly with that King for many Years; in which whole History
there is not the least Mention made of Guards or Garisons, but only
of Porters or Doorkeepers; which in his native Tongue, he calls
Ushers.</p>

<p>Now as to the third Mark of <i>Tyranny</i>, which is when
Matters are so carried, that what is done tends more to the Profit
and Will of the <i>Person governing</i>, than to that of the
<i>governed</i>, or the Good of the <i>Commonwealth</i>; we shall
hereafter prove, that the <i>Supreme</i> Administration of the
<i>Francogallican Kingdom was lodged in the Publick Annual Council
of the Nation, which in After-Ages was called the Convention of the
Three Estates</i>. For the Frame of this Government was the very
same which the <i>Ancient Philosophers</i>, and among them
<i>Plato</i> and <i>Aristotle</i> (whom <i>Polybius</i> imitates)
judged to be the best and most excellent in the World, as being
made up and constituted of a Mixture and just Temperament of the
three Kinds of Government, <i>viz</i>. the <i>Regal, Noble</i>, and
<i>Popular</i>. Which Form of a <i>Commonwealth, Cicero</i> (in his
Books <i>de Republic&acirc;</i>) prefers to all other whatsoever.
For since a <i>Kingly</i> and a <i>Popular</i> Government do in
their Natures differ widely from each other, it was necessary to
add a <i>third</i> and <i>middle State</i> participating of both,
<i>viz</i>. that of the <i>Princes</i> or <i>Nobility</i>; who, by
Reason of the Splendor and Antiquity of their Families, approach,
in some Degree, to the <i>Kingly Dignity</i>; and yet, being
<i>Subjects</i>, are upon that Account on the same Foot and
Interest with the <i>Commons</i>. Now of the Excellency of this
Temperament in a Commonwealth, we have a most remarkable
Commendation in Cicero, taken by him out of <i>Plato</i>'s Books
<i>de Republic&acirc;</i>; which, because of its singular Elegancy,
we shall here insert at length.</p>

<p>"Ut in fidibus (inquit) ac tibiis, atque cantu ips&ograve;, ac
vocibus, tenendus est quidam concentus ex distinctis sonis, quem
immutatum ac discrepantem aures erudit&aelig; ferre non possunt; isque
concentus ex dissimillimarium vocum moderatione concors tamen
efficitur, &amp; congruens; Sic ex summis, &amp; mediis, &amp;
infimis interjectis ordinibus, ut sonis, moderat&acirc; ratione
<i>civitas</i>, consensu dissimillimorum, concinit, &amp; qu&aelig;
<i>harmonia</i> a musicis dicitur in <i>cantu</i>, ea est in
<i>Civitate concordia</i>: arctissimum atq; optimum in Repub.
vinculum incolumitatis, qu&aelig; fine justiti&acirc; nullo pacto esse
potest. <i>i. e.</i> As in Fiddles and Flutes, and even in Singing
and Voices, a certain Consort of distinct Sounds is to be observed;
which if it be alter'd, or not tunable, skilful Hearers cannot bear
or endure: And this Consort of very different Tones, is, through as
just Proportion of the Notes, rendred Concord, and very agreeable:
Even so a Commonwealth, judiciously proportioned, and composed of
the <i>first</i>, the <i>middlemost</i>, and the <i>lowest</i> of
the <i>States</i>, (just as in the Sounds) through the Consent of
People very unlike to each other, becomes agreeable: And what
Musicians in Singing call <i>Harmony</i>, that in a Commonwealth is
<i>Concord</i>; the very best and strongest Bond of Safety for a
Government, which can never fail of being accompanied with
<i>Justice</i>." Our Ancestors therefore following this Method, of
a just Mixture of all the three Kinds, in the constituting their
Commonwealth, most wisely ordained, that every Year on the
<i>Calends</i> of <i>May</i>, a Publick <i>Council</i> of the whole
Nation should be held: at which <i>Council</i> the great Affairs of
the Republick shou'd be transacted by the common Consent and Advice
of all the <i>Estates</i>. The Wisdom and Advantage of which
Institution, appears chiefly in these three things: First, That in
the Multitude of prudent Counsellors, the Weight and Excellency of
Counsel shews it self more apparently, as <i>Solomon</i> and other
Wise Men have said. Secondly, <i>Because it is an essential part of
liberty, that the same persons, at whose cost and peril any thing
is done, shou'd have it done likewise by their authority and
advice: for</i> ('tis a common Saying) <i>what concerns all, ought
to be approved by all</i>. Lastly, That such Ministers of State as
have great Power with the Prince, and are in high Employments, may
be kept within the Bounds of their Duty, thro' the Awe they stand
in of this <i>great Council</i>, in which all the Demands and
Grievances of the Subject are freely laid open.&mdash;"For such
Kingdoms as are ruled by the arbitrary Will and Pleasure of <i>one
Prince</i>, may most justly (as <i>Aristotle</i> in his third Book
of Politicks observes) be reckon'd Governments of Sheep; and brute
Beasts, without Wit or judgment; not of Freemen, who are endued
with Understanding, and the Light of Reason." The Case is
thus&mdash;That even as Sheep are not guided or tended by one of
their own Kind, nor Boys govern'd by one of themselves, but by
something of more Excellency; even so a Multitude of Men ought not
to be ruled and govern'd by one single Person, who perhaps
understands and sees less than several others among them; but by
many select Persons, who, in the Opinion of all Men, are both very
prudent and eminent; and who act by united Counsels, and, as it
were, by one Spirit, composed and made up of the Minds of many Wise
Men.</p>

<p>Now whereas it may be objected, that most Kings have a constant
<i>Privy Council</i> to advise them in the Administration of
publick Affairs: We answer, That there is a great deal of
Difference between a Counsellor of the <i>King</i>, and a
Counsellor of the <i>Kingdom</i>. This last takes care of the
Safety and Profit of the whole Commonwealth; the other serves the
Humour and studies the Conveniences of one Man only; and besides,
these King's Counsellors reside, for the most part, in one certain Place; or at
least near the Person of the Prince, where they cannot be supposed
to be throughly acquainted with the Condition of the more remote
Cities or Provinces; and being debauched by the Luxury of a Court
life, are easily depraved, and acquire a lawless Appetite of
Domineering; are wholly intent upon their own ambitious and
covetous Designs; so that at last they are no longer to be
consider'd as Counsellors for the Good of the Kingdom and
Commonwealth, but Flatterers of a single Person, and Slaves to
their own and Prince's Lusts.</p>

<p>Concerning this Matter, we have a most excellent Saying of the
Emperor <i>Aurelian</i>, recorded by <i>Flavius
Vopiscus</i>.&mdash;"My Father used to tell me (says
<i>Aurelian</i>) that the Emperor <i>Dioclesian</i>, whilst he was
yet a private Man, frequently said, That nothing in the World was
more difficult than to govern well. For, four or five Persons
combine together, and unanimously agree to deceive the Emperor they
determine what shall be approved or disapprov'd. The Emperor, who,
for the most part, is shut up in his Palace, knows nothing of the
Truth of Affairs; he is compell'd to hear and see only with their
Ears and Eyes; he makes judges, such Persons as do not deserve to
be made so; he removes from Offices in the Commonwealth such as he
ought to keep in; in short, a good, provident and excellent Emperor
is sold by such Counsellors."&mdash;Now our Ancestors, in the
constituting their Commonwealth, wisely avoiding these Mischiefs
(as Mariners wou'd do dangerous Rocks) decreed that the
<i>Publick</i> Affairs shou'd be managed by the joynt Advice and
Counsel of <i>all</i> the <i>Estates</i> of the <i>Kingdom</i>. To
which Purpose the <i>King</i>, the <i>Nobles</i>, and the
<i>Representatives</i> of the <i>Commons</i> out of the several
Provinces, were obliged to meet at a certain Time every Year. And
this very same Institution we find to have been that of many other
Nations. First in our Ancient <i>Gallia</i>, where the
Administration of Publick Affairs was intrusted with the <i>Common
Councel of the chosen Men in the whole Nation</i> as we have above
demonstrated. But because we are now speaking of a Kingdom, I shall
give Instances of them. 'Tis man felt, that in old Times the
Council of the <i>Amphictions</i> was instituted in <i>Greece</i>
(as <i>Suidas</i> and others testify) by King <i>Amphyction</i>,
Son of <i>Deucalion</i>; and therein it was ordained, that at a
certain appointed Time every Year, <i>Representatives</i> chosen
out of the Twelve Commonwealths of <i>Greece</i> shou'd meet at
<i>Thermopyl&aelig;</i>, and deliberate concerning all the weighty
Affairs of the Kingdom and Commonwealth: For which Reason,
<i>Cicero</i> calls this the <i>Common Council of Gr&aelig;cia</i>,
<i>Pliny</i> calls it the <i>Publick Council</i>.</p>

<p>We find the like Wisdom in the Constitution of the <i>German
Empire</i>, wherein the <i>Emperor</i> represents the
<i>Monarchical</i> State, the <i>Princes</i> represent the
<i>Aristocratical</i>, and the <i>Deputies of the Cities</i> the
<i>Democratical</i>; neither can any Matter of Moment appertaining
to the whole <i>German Republick</i> be firm and ratified, but what
is first agreed upon in that <i>great Convention of the Three
Estates</i>. To this End was framed that ancient and famous Law of
the <i>Lacedemonians</i>, which joyned the <i>Ephori</i> to their
<i>Kings</i>; "Who, as Plato writes, were designed to be like
Bridles to the Kings, and the Kings were obliged to govern the
Commonwealth by their Advice and Authority." <i>Pliny</i>, lib. 6.
cap. 22. makes mention of the like Practice in the Island of
<i>Taprobana</i>, where the King had thirty Advisers appointed by
the People; by whose Counsel he was to be guided in the Government
of the Commonwealth; "For fear (says he) lest the King if he had an
unlimited Power should esteem his Subjects no otherwise than as his
<i>Slaves</i> or his <i>Cattel</i>."</p>

<p>Furthermore, we find the very same Form of Administration of the
Kingdom of England, in <i>Polydore Virgil</i>'s History of
<i>England</i>, lib. 11. where he has this Passage in the Life of
<i>Henry</i> the First.&mdash;"Before this Time the Kings used to
summon a publick Convention of the People in order to consult with
them, but seldom: So that we may in some Manner say, that the
Institution derived its Original from <i>Henry</i>: which took such
deep Root, that it has always continued ever since, and still does
so; <i>viz.</i> That whatever related to the Well governing or
Conservation of the <i>Commonwealth</i>, ought to be debated and
determin'd by the <i>great Council</i>. And that if either the
<i>King</i> or the <i>People</i> shou'd act any thing <i>alone</i>,
it shou'd be esteemed <i>invalid</i>, and as <i>nothing</i>, unless
it were first approved and established by the <i>Authority of that
Council</i>. And for fear this <i>Council</i> shou'd be cumbred
with the Opinions of an <i>unskilful Multitude</i>, (whose Custom
it is to distinguish nothing justly) it was at first establish'd by
a certain Law, what <i>Sort</i> of Persons, and what <i>Numbers</i>
either of the <i>Priests</i> or of the <i>People</i> shou'd be
called to this <i>Council</i>, which, after a <i>French</i> Name,
they commonly call <i>A Parliament</i>; which every King at the
Beginning of his Reign uses to hold, and as often afterward as he
pleases, or as <i>Occasion</i> requires." Thus far <i>Polydore
Virgil</i>.</p>

<p>But among all the Laws and Customs of this Kind, there is none
so remarkable as that of the <i>Spaniards</i>; who, when they
<i>elect</i> a King in the <i>Common-Council</i> of <i>Arragon</i>,
(in order to keep up a perpetual Remembrance of their Privileges)
represent a Kind of Play, and introduce a certain <i>Personage</i>,
whom they call by the Name of <i>The Law of Arragon</i>, [Footnote:
<i>La justitia di Arragon</i>.] whom (by a publick Decree) they
declare to be greater and more Powerful than their King; and
afterwards they harangue the King (who is elected upon certain
Terms and Conditions) in Words which (because of the remarkable
Virtue and Fortitude of that Nation in repressing the <i>unbridled
Will</i> of their Prince,) we will here set down at
length.&mdash;"Nos que valemos tanto come vos, ii podemos mas que
vos; vos elegimos Reii con estas ii estas Conditiones; intra vos ii
nos un que manda mas que vos: That is, We, who are of as great
Value as you, and can do more than you, do elect you to be our
King, upon such and such Conditions: Between you and us there is
<i>one</i> of <i>greater Authority</i> than you."</p>

<p>Seeing then that the Case is so, and that <i>this has always
been a constant and universal Law of all Nations, that are governed
by a Kingly, and not by a Tyrannical Power</i>: 'Tis very plain,
that this most valuable Liberty of holding a <i>Common-Council</i>
of the Nation, is not only a Part of the <i>People's Right</i>; but
that all Kings, who by Evil Arts do oppress or take away this
<i>Sacred Right</i>, ought to be esteemed <i>Violators of the Laws
of Nations</i>; and being no better than <i>Enemies of Human
Society</i>, must be consider'd not as <i>Kings</i>, but as
<i>Tyrants</i>.</p>

<p>But to return to the Matter in Hand. Our Commonwealth being
constituted by the Laws of our Ancestors, upon the Bottom
above-mention'd, and participating of all the three Kinds of
Government; it was ordain'd, that once every Year (and as much
oftner as important Occasions should make it necessary) a <i>Solemn
General Council</i> shou'd be held: Which for that Reason, was
called a <i>Parliament</i> of the <i>Three Estates</i>. By that
Word was meant a Convention or Meeting of Men out of several Parts
of the Country to one Place, there to confer and deliberate
concerning the Publick Welfare: And therefore all Conferences (tho'
between Enemies) in order to a Peace or Truce are always in our
Chronicles called by the Name of <i>Parliaments</i>. Now of this
Council, the <i>King</i> sitting in his Golden Tribunnal, was
<i>chief</i>; next to him were the <i>Princes</i> and
<i>Magistrates</i> of the Kingdom; in the third Place were the
<i>Representatives</i> of the several Towns and Provinces, commonly
called the <i>Deputies</i>: For as soon as the Day prefix'd for
this Assembly was come, the <i>King</i> was conducted to the
Parliament House with a Sort of Pomp and Ceremony, more <i>adapted
to popular Moderation</i>, than to <i>Regal Magnificence</i>: which
I shall not scruple to give a just account of out of our own
Publick Records; it being a Sort of <i>Piety</i> to be pleas'd with
the Wisdom of our Ancestors; tho' in these most profligate Times, I
doubt not but it wou'd appear ridiculous to our flattering
Courtiers. The King then was seated in a <i>Waggon</i>, and drawn
by <i>Oxen</i>, which a <i>Waggoner</i> drove with his <i>Goad</i>
to the Place of Assembly: But as soon as he was arrived at the
Court, or rather indeed the Venerable <i>Palace of the
Republick</i>, the Nobles conducted the King to the Golden Throne;
and the rest took their Places (as we said before) according to
their Degrees. This <i>State</i>, and in this <i>Place</i>, was
what was called <i>Regia Majestas, Royal Majesty</i>. Of which we
may even at this Day observe a signal Remain in the King's Broad
Seal, commonly called the <i>Chancery</i> Seal. Wherein the King is
not represented in a <i>military Posture</i> a Horse-back, or in a
<i>Triumphant Manner</i> drawn in his Chariot by Horses, but
sitting in his Throne <i>Robe'd</i> and <i>Crown'd</i>, holding in
his Right Hand the Royal Sceptre, in his Left the Sceptre of
Justice, and presiding in his <i>Solemn Council</i>. And indeed, in
that Place only it can be said that <i>Royal Majesty</i> does truly
and properly reside, where the great Affairs of the Commonwealth
are transacted; and not as the unskilful Vulgar use to profane the
Word; and whether the King plays or dances, or prattles with his
Women, always to stile him YOUR MAJESTY.</p>

<p>Of all these Matters, we shall give only a few Proofs, out of
many which we could produce. First, out of <i>Eginarthus</i>, who
was <i>Chancellor</i> to <i>Charles the Great</i>, and wrote his
Life. These are his Words: "Wherever he went (speaking of
<i>Charlemagn</i>) <i>about the publick Affairs</i>: he was drawn
in a Waggon by a Pair of Oxen, which an ordinary Waggoner drove
after his rustical Manner. Thus he went to the Courts of Justice,
thus to the Place of the Publick Convention of his People, which
every Year was celebrated for the Good of the Realm; and thus he
used to return Home again."</p>

<p><i>Joannes Nauclerus</i> gives us an Account of the very same
Thing, in almost the same Words, in <i>Chron. Generat. 26</i>. So
does the <i>Author</i> of the <i>Great Chronicle</i>, in the
Beginning of his Life of <i>Charlemagn</i>, Fol. 77. Neither ought
this to seem so great a Wonder to any, who considers it was the
Fashion in those Days for our Kings and Queens, and the Royal
Family, to be drawn by <i>Oxen</i>; of which we have one Instance
in <i>Greg. Turon. lib. 3. cap. 26. "Deuteria</i>, (says he) Wife
of King <i>Childebert</i>, seeing her Daughter by a former Husband
grown to Woman's Estate, and fearing lest the King (being in Love
with her) should lye with her, caused her to be put into a Sort of
Litter with untamed Oxen, and thrown Headlong off a Bridge."
<i>Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 30.</i> makes mention of the Golden
Throne, where he speaks of King <i>Dagobert</i>: "He proclaimed,
says he, <i>Generale PLACITUM in loco nuncupato
Bigargio</i>, a <i>Great Council</i> in a Place named
<i>Bigargium</i>: To which all the Great Men of <i>France</i>
assembling with great Diligence on the Kalends of <i>May</i>, the
King thus began his Speech to them, sitting on his <i>Golden
Throne</i>." Also in his 41st Chapter, speaking of King
<i>Clodoveus</i>&mdash;Sitting in the midst of them, on his
<i>Golden Throne</i>, he spoke in this Manner, &amp;c.
<i>Sigebertus in Chron. Anni 662</i>.&mdash;"'Tis the Ancient
Custom (says he) of the Kings of the <i>Franks</i>, every
<i>Kalends of May</i>, to preside in a Convention of all the
People, to salute and be saluted, to receive Homage, and give and
take Presents." <i>Georgius Cedrenus</i> expresses this in almost
the same Words: &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&#940; &delta;&#8050;
&tau;&#8056;&nu; &Mu;&#940;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;
&mu;&#8134;&nu;&alpha;

&#7936;&nu;&tau;&iota;&delta;&iota;&delta;&#972;&nu;&alpha;&iota;
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;&#8145;&sigmaf;.</p>

<p>Now, concerning the <i>Authority</i> of the <i>People</i>, who
were thus gather'd together at the <i>Great Council</i>, we have
many Testimonies, <i>Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 41.</i> speaking of
<i>Clodoveus</i> the Second; "Altho' (says that King in his Speech)
the Care of our Earthly Principality <i>obliges</i> us to call you
together <i>Francigen&aelig; cives</i>, and to consult you in Affairs
relating to the Publick, &amp;c."&mdash;Also in his 74th Chapter of
the same Book&mdash;"In the Beginning of the Year he went into
<i>Saxony</i>, and there he held a <i>General Convention every
Year</i>, as he used to do every Year in <i>France</i>
also."&mdash;Again, <i>lib. 4. cap. 13.</i> where he speaks of
<i>Charles</i> the Great&mdash;"When the Hunting near <i>Aix la
Chapelle</i> was ended, as soon as he return'd, he held a
<i>General Convention</i> of his People, according to usual Custom,
&amp;c. <i>Cap.</i> 116. The Emperor having held Two
<i>Conventions</i>, one at <i>Nimeguen</i>, the other at
<i>Compiegn</i>, wherein he receiv'd the Annual Presents, &amp;c.
Again, <i>Cap.</i> 117. In the Month of <i>August</i> he came to
<i>Wormes</i>, and holding there the General Convention according
to constant Practice, he received the Yearly Gifts which were
offer'd him, and gave Audience to several Ambassadors, &amp;c.
Again, <i>Lib. 5. cap. 31</i>. The General <i>Placitum</i> was held
on the Ides of <i>June</i>, in the Town <i>Dusiacum</i>."</p>

<p>And this may suffice touching this solemn <i>General
Council</i>, which both <i>French</i> and <i>German</i> Historians,
thro' a deprav'd Custom of the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, called by
different Names; sometimes <i>Curia</i>, sometimes <i>Conventus
Generalis</i>, but for the most Part <i>Placitum. Gregorius, lib. 7
cap. 14</i> says thus:&mdash;"Therefore when the Time of the
<i>Placitum</i> approached, they were directed by King
<i>Childebert, &amp;c. Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 109</i>. In the middle
of the Month he held the General Convention at <i>Thionville</i>,
where there was a very great Appearance of the People of the
<i>Franks</i>; and in this <i>Placitum</i>, the singular Compassion
of the most Pious Emperor eminently show'd it self, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Now it was the Custom in that <i>Council</i> to send Presents
from all Parts to the King; as may appear from many Places which
might be quoted, wherein that <i>Council</i> is called <i>Conventus
Generalis. Aimoinus, lib. 4. cap. 64</i>. speaking of King
<i>Pipin</i>&mdash;"He compell'd them (says he) to promise they
would obey all his Commands, and to send him every Year at the Time
of the <i>General Convention</i>, Three Hundred Horses, as a Gift
and Token of Respect. <i>Item, cap. 85</i>. Not forgetting the
Perfidy of the <i>Saxons</i>, he held the <i>General Convention</i>
beyond the <i>Rhine</i>, in the Town of <i>Kufftein</i>, according

<p>This <i>Council</i> was sometimes called by another Name,
<i>Curia</i>, the <i>Court</i>; from whence proceeded the common
Saying, when People went to the <i>King's Hall</i> or <i>Palace, we
are going to Court</i>; because they seldom approach'd the King,
but upon great Occasions, and when a <i>Council</i> was call'd.
<i>Aimoinus, lib. 5. cap. 50. "Charles</i>, (says he) the Son of

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> Sacred Authority <i>of the</i> Publick
Council; <i>and what Affairs were wont to be transacted
therein</i>.</p>

<p>We think it necessary in this Place to consider what Kind of
Affairs were wont to be transacted in this general <i>Annual
Council</i>, and to admire the great <i>Wisdom</i> of our Ancestors
in <i>constituting our Republick</i>. We have (in short) observed
that they are these that follow. First, the <i>Creating or
abdicating of their Kings</i>. Next, the <i>declaring of Peace or
War</i>. The <i>making of all Publick Laws</i>: The
<i>Conferring</i> of all <i>great Honours, Commands</i>, or
<i>Offices</i> belonging to the <i>Commonwealth</i>: The
<i>assigning</i> of any <i>part</i> of the <i>deceased King's
Patrimony</i> to his Children, or giving <i>Portions</i> to his
<i>Daughters</i>, which they usually called by a <i>German</i> Name
<i>Abannagium</i>; that is, <i>pars exclusoria</i>, a Part set out
for younger Children. Lastly, all such Matters as in Popular Speech
are commonly called <i>Affairs of State</i>: Because it was not
lawful to determine or debate of any Thing relating to the
<i>Commonwealth</i>, but in the <i>General Council</i> of the
<i>States</i>.</p>

<p>We have already produced sufficient Proofs of the
<i>Electing</i> and <i>Abdicating</i> their <i>Kings</i>, as well
from the last <i>Will</i> and <i>Testament</i> of <i>Charles</i>
the <i>Great</i>, as from several other Authors: To which we will
add this one Passage more out of <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 5. cap. 17.
where speaking of <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bald</i>, he says
thus,&mdash;"Having summon'd a <i>General Council</i> at [Footnote:
<i>Crecy</i>.] <i>Carifiacum</i>, he there first gave his Son
<i>Charles arma virilia</i>; that is, he girt him with a Sword, or
knighted him, and putting a Regal Crown upon his Head, assign'd
<i>Neustria</i> to him, as he did <i>Aquitain</i> to
<i>Pippin</i>."</p>

<p>Now concerning the <i>Administration</i> of the <i>Kingdom</i>,
<i>Aimoinus</i> gives us this remarkable Instance, <i>lib.</i> 5.
<i>cap.</i> 35. speaking of <i>Charles</i> the <i>Bald</i>.
"<i>Charles</i> (says he) being about taking a Journey to
<i>Rome</i>, held a general <i>Placitum</i> on the Kalends of
<i>June</i> at <i>Compeign</i>; and therein was ordained under
particular Heads, after what Manner his Son <i>Lewis</i> should
govern the Kingdom of <i>France</i>, in <i>Conjunction</i> with his
<i>Nobles</i>, and the rest of the <i>Faithful People</i> of the
<i>Realm</i>, till such time as he returned from <i>Rome</i>."</p>

<p>Also in the same Book, <i>cap.</i> 42. speaking of
<i>Charles</i> the <i>Simple</i>: "Whose Youth (says he) the
principal Men of <i>France</i> judging (as it was indeed) very
unfit for the exercise of the Government of the Realm, they held a
<i>General Council</i> touching these weighty Affairs; and the
great Men of the <i>Franks</i>, <i>Burgundians</i>, and
<i>Aquitanians</i> being assembled, elected <i>Odo</i> to be
<i>Charles'</i>s <i>Tutor</i> and <i>Governor</i> of the
Kingdom."</p>

<p>Now concerning <i>the Power</i> of <i>making Laws</i> and
<i>Ordinances</i>, that single Passage in <i>Gaguinus'</i>s Life of
St. <i>Lewis</i> is a sufficient Proof. "As soon (says he) as King
<i>Lewis</i> arrived at <i>Paris</i>, he called a <i>General
Convention</i>, and <i>therein</i> reformed the Commonwealth;
making excellent Statutes relating to the Judges, and against the
Venality of Offices, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Concerning the <i>conferring</i> the <i>great Honours and
Employments</i> upon <i>Persons of approved Worth, Aimoinus lib.
5. cap. 36.</i> gives us this Instance; speaking of <i>Charles</i>
the <i>Bald</i>, he tells us, "That whereas he began (before his
Inauguration) to distribute the Governments and great Offices of
the Realm according to his own liking; the <i>Great Men summoned a
General Council</i>, and sent Ambassadors to the King; neither
would they admit him to be crowned till he had made use of their
Advice and Authority in disposing of those great Employments. The
Nobles (says he) being very much displeas'd, because the King
<i>conferr'd Honours without their Consent</i>; for that Reason,
agreed together against him, and summoned a <i>general
Convention</i> in the Town of <i>Witmar</i>, from whence they sent
Ambassadors to <i>Lewis</i>, as <i>Lewis</i> likewise sent his
Ambassadors to them, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Also the Appendix to <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours,
lib. 11. cap. 54</i>. "That same Year (says he) King <i>Clotharius,
cum Proceribus &amp; Leudibus</i>, i. e. with the Nobility and free
Subjects of <i>Burgundy</i>, met at <i>Troyes</i>, and when he
earnestly solicited them to advance another Person to the same
Place and Degree of Honour which <i>Warnhar</i> (lately deceased)
had enjoy'd, they unanimously refused to do it; and said, they
would by no Means have any <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>, earnestly
desiring the King to excuse them:" And thus they gained their Point
with the King.</p>

<p>To this Head may be referr'd all <i>the Contentions</i> of such
<i>Princes</i>, as were foreseen might be <i>dangerous to the
Commonwealth</i>. These were debated in the <i>General Council</i>.
For <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 4 cap. I. where he speaks of
<i>Clotharius</i>, Son of <i>Chilperic</i>, from whom Queen
<i>Brunechild</i> demanded the Kingdom of <i>Austratia</i>, says
thus:&mdash;"<i>Clotharius</i> made answer, that she ought to call
a <i>Convention</i> of the <i>Nobles</i> of the <i>Franks</i>, and
there debate (by common Consent) an Affair relating to the
Community. That as for him, he would submit to their judgment in
all Things, and would not obstruct in any Measure whatever they
should command." The same Thing is recorded in the <i>Appendix</i>
to <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours</i>, lib. II. "<i>Clotharius</i>
(says he) made Answer to her, that he would refer the Difference
between them, to the Determination of the <i>Select Franks</i>, and
promis'd to fulfil whatsoever they should ordain." Also
<i>Aimoinus</i> lib. 5. cap. 12. where he speaks of King
<i>Lewis</i> the <i>Pious</i>, who was grievously tormented with
the Contentions of his Sons, says thus,&mdash;"When Autumn
approached, they whose Sentiments differ'd from the Emperor's, were
for having the <i>General Convention</i> held in some Town of
<i>France</i>.&mdash;<i>Item</i> cap.13. He appointed the <i>General
Convention</i> of his People to be held at <i>Thionville</i>. And
after a little Time, summon'd his People to meet on the Feast of
St. <i>Martin</i>, and used all his Endeavours to recal his Son
<i>Pipin</i> who had absented himself; but he refused to come,
&amp;c." <i>Gaguinus</i> making Mention of this Same Passage, says;
"When the Conspirators found out they should not be able to
dethrone the King, without the Consent of the <i>Nobility in
Convention</i>, they labour'd by all Means to have the <i>Great
Council</i> held within the Limits of <i>France</i>. But
<i>Lewis</i> knowing for certain that those <i>Franks</i> were
gained by his Enemies against him, refused it, and summon'd the
Convention to meet at <i>Mentz</i>, and ordered that none should be
admitted <i>Armed</i> to the Council. But his Sons, (who had
conspired against their Father) lest they should want the
<i>Authority</i> of a <i>Publick Convention</i>, assembled a
Council at <i>Compiegne</i>, consisting of the Bishops and Nobility
of the Kingdom. And <i>Lotharius</i> taking his Father out of
Custody, brought him to <i>Compiegne</i>."</p>

<p>Again, <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 5. cap. 38. where he speaks of
Lewis <i>the Stammerer</i>, who held a <i>Council</i> at
<i>Marsua</i>, wherein he treated a Peace with his Cousin, says:
"In that <i>Placitum</i>, or <i>Parliament</i>, these Articles
which follow were agreed upon between them, <i>by and with the
Consent of the faithful Subjects of the Realm</i>."</p>

<p>To proceed, We find further, that it was the Custom (when any
<i>Prince</i>, or <i>Person</i> of <i>Extraordinary Quality</i>,
was <i>accused of any Crime</i>) to summon him to appear before the
<i>Great Council</i>, and there he was to stand his <i>Trial</i>.
Thus in the Reign of King <i>Clotharius</i>, when <i>Queen
Brunechild</i> stood accused, and was found guilty of many capital
Crimes, the King made a Speech to the Estates of the <i>Great
Council of Francogallia</i>, in these Words; which are recorded by
<i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 4. cap 1. "It belongs to you, my most dear
Fellow-Soldiers, and high Nobility of <i>France</i>, to appoint
what Kind of Punishment ought to be inflicted on a Person guilty of
such enormous Crimes, &amp;c." And <i>Ado &AElig;tat 6. sub Anno</i>
583. tells us, "The <i>Franks</i> passing Sentence upon her in the
King's Presence, condemn'd her to be torn in Pieces by wild
Horses."</p>

<p>Now concerning the <i>dividing</i> of the <i>Royal Patrimon</i>,
and the <i>Appanages</i>, we have the same Person's Testimony,
<i>lib. 5. cap. 94</i>. where speaking of <i>Charlemagn</i>, he has
these Words&mdash;"These Matters being ended, the King held a
<i>Convention</i> of the <i>Nobility and Gentry</i> of the
<i>Franks</i>, for the making and maintaining a firm Peace among
his Sons, and dividing the Kingdom into Three Parts, that every one
of them might know what Part of it he ought to defend and govern,
in Case they survived him."&mdash;Also in that Place where he speaks
of the Partition made among the Children of <i>Lewis</i>, lib. 5.
cap. 40. he says thus.&mdash;"They went to <i>Amiens</i>, and there
they divided their Father's Kingdom among them, <i>according to the
Advice and Direction of their faithful Subjects</i>." Further,
<i>cap.</i> 41. where he writes of <i>Carloman</i>, who held his <i>Great
Council</i> then at <i>Worms</i>.&mdash;"To this <i>Placitum</i>
(says he) came <i>Hugo</i>, and preferred his Petition for that
Part of the Kingdom, which his Brother <i>Lewis (in Locarium
acceperat)</i> had rented of him, or received in Pawn."</p>

<p>We may further observe, from very many Instances, that whenever
the King had any expensive Design in Hand, such as the Building of
Churches or Monasteries, he took first the Advice of the
<i>Council</i> of the <i>Estates</i>. For <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 4.
cap. 41. where he speaks of <i>Clodoveus</i> the Second, tells us,
that sitting on his Throne, he began his Oration to the <i>General
Council</i> in these Words.&mdash;<i>"Quamquam Francigin&aelig; cives,
&amp;c.</i> Altho' (says he) the Care I ought to take of my
Kingdom, obliges me to take your Advice in all Matters relating to
the Publick, &amp;c."</p>

<p>And thus much may suffice on this Point. From all which we think
it appears plainly, that the whole Power of the Administration of
the Kingdom was lodg'd in the <i>Publick Council</i>, which they
called <i>Placitum</i>; because according to the Idiom of the
<i>Latin</i> Tongue, <i>that</i> is properly termed
<i>Placitum</i>, which after having been proposed and debated in a
Council of many Persons, is at last agreed to, and resolved upon by
them. And therefore <i>Cicero</i>, with others of the Ancients,
were wont to call such-like Determinations, <i>Placita
Philosophorum</i>.</p>

<p>Since therefore the Matter is so, I hope the Opinion which we
have formerly given in some of our other Books, will not be
esteemed absurd; <i>viz</i>. That the common Form used by the
King's Secretary in the last Clause of our Ordinances and Edits,
<i>Quia tale est PLACITUM nostrum</i>, arises from hence: For
anciently those Laws were written in the <i>Latin Tongue</i>, (as
is sufficiently proved by <i>Aimoinus</i>, the <i>Capitulary of
Charles the Great</i>, and many other Records); but afterwards when
the King's Secretaries or Clerks began to make Use of the Vulgar
Tongue, thro' Ignorance, or rather Malice, they translated it
thus,&mdash;<i>Car tel est nostre Plaisir: For such is our Will and
Pleasure</i>.</p>

<p>Now as to the <i>Power</i> of the <i>People</i>, we have this
farther Argument extant in the same Capitulary of <i>Charles the
Great</i>.&mdash;"Let the <i>People</i> (says it) be consulted
touching all the Heads of the new Laws, which are to be added to
the former; and after they have <i>all given their Consents</i>,
let them set their Hands and Seals to every Article."</p>

<p>From which Words, 'tis apparent that the People of <i>France</i>
were wont to be bound by such Laws <i>only</i>, as they had
publickly agreed to in their <i>Parliaments</i>. Also <i>in fine
Leg. Aleman</i>. we find this Passage.&mdash;"This is decreed by
the <i>King</i> and his <i>Nobles</i>, and all the Christian
<i>People</i> which compose the Kingdom of the
<i>Merovingians</i>." Also <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 5 cap.
38.&mdash;"In this <i>Placitum</i> the Laws which follow were
agreed upon, to be observed between them, by the <i>Consent</i> of
the faithful <i>Subjects</i>.&mdash;An Agreement made between the
Glorious Kings, &amp;c. by the <i>Advice</i> and <i>Consent</i> of
their faithful Commons, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Lastly, we cannot omit observing, that so great was the
<i>Reputation</i> and <i>Authority</i> of this <i>General
Council</i>, even among <i>Strangers</i>, that <i>foreign
Princes</i> submitted to have their Controversies and Differences
decided by it. The <i>Appendix</i> to <i>Greg. Turon</i>. lib. 11.
cap. 37. <i>Anno</i> 12. of <i>Theodorick</i>'s Reign, has this
Passage in it.&mdash;"When <i>Alsaciones</i>, [perhaps
<i>Alsatia</i>] in which Country he had been brought up, and which
was left him by his Father <i>Childebert</i>, fell nevertheless to
<i>Theodebert</i>, according to the Custom in Use among the
<i>Barbarians</i>; the two Kings agreed that their Difference
should be decided by the judgment of the <i>Franks</i>, (in
<i>Salocissa castro</i>) in their Camp near the River
<i>Sala</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII" />CHAP. XII.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Kingly Officers, commonly call'd</i>
Mayors of the Palace.</p>

<p>Before we treat farther of the <i>uninterrupted Authority</i> of
the <i>Publick Council</i>, we think it not improper to say
somewhat of those Regal great Officers, which, during the
<i>Merovingian</i> Race were called (<i>Majores domus</i>) Masters,
or <i>Mayors of the Palace</i>. These having for some Time
encroach'd upon the Kingly Power, finding at last a fit
Opportunity, seiz'd upon it entirely as their own. Their Dignity
near the Persons of our Kings seems to have been much the same with
that of <i>Pr&aelig;fecti Pretorio</i>, or Generals of the Guards in the
Time of the <i>Roman</i> Emperors, who were sometimes also titled
<i>Aul&aelig; Pr&aelig;fecti</i>. They were usually appointed in and by the
same <i>Convention</i> which chose the <i>Kings</i>, and were wont
to be Chiefs or Heads of the <i>Publick Council</i>. And upon this
Account we frequently meet with such-like Expressions as these
among our Historians.&mdash;"They elected such and such a Man to
the Dignity of <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>. <i>Herchinold, Mayor of
the Palace</i>, being dead, the <i>Franks</i> conferr'd that
Dignity upon <i>Ebroinus</i>, and appointed him to be <i>Mayor</i>
in the King's Court." Also&mdash;"They chose <i>Hilderick</i> for
their <i>King</i>, and <i>Wolfold</i> for <i>Mayor of the
Palace</i>." Which Quotations of ours might indeed have been made
as properly in out foregoing Chapter, where we proved that the
greater Employments were not usually given by the <i>Kings</i>, but
appointed by the Yearly <i>General</i> Council, and conferred upon
Men of the greatest Fidelity and Probity.</p>

<p>But in this Magistracy, the same Thing hapned, which
<i>Plutarch</i> tells us (in his Life of <i>Lysander</i>) came to
pass when <i>Agesilaus</i> was appointed by the
<i>Lacedemonians</i> to be <i>General</i> of their Army, and
<i>Lysander</i> to be Legate or Lieutenant-General: "Even as in
Stage-Plays, (says he) the Actors who represent a Servant or
Messenger, have better Parts, and are more regarded than him that
wears the Crown and Scepter, who scarce speaks a Word in the whole
Play: So the chief Authority and Command was lodg'd in
<i>Lysander</i>, whilst with the <i>King</i> remained only a naked
and empty Title."&mdash;Just so it fell out in our
<i>Francogallia</i>; Fair Opportunities of increasing the Power of
these <i>Mayors</i> of the Palace, being offer'd by the Sloth and
Negligence of our <i>Kings</i>; among whom we may reckon
<i>Dagobert, Clodoveus, Clotharius, Childericus, Theodoricus</i>,
&amp;c. For the Author of the History of the <i>Franks</i>, often
cited by <i>Venericus Vercellensis</i>, tho' without naming him,
writes, That during the Reign of <i>Clotharius</i>, Father of
<i>Dagobert</i>, the Kingdom of the <i>Franks</i> began to be
administred and govern'd by some which were called <i>Provisores
Regi&aelig;</i>, or <i>Majores Domus</i>. The same says <i>Godf. Viterb.
parte Chron.</i> 16. Whereupon, whilst those <i>Mayors</i> of the
<i>Palace</i> executed all the important Affairs of the
Commonwealth, and commanded all the Armies in Time of War; and the
Kings (spending their Days in Sloth and Idleness) tarried at Home,
content with the bare Title of a King; Matters at last were brought
to such a Pass, that during the Reign of <i>Childerick</i> the 18th
<i>King</i>, Pipin, <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>, (who in the King's
Name had waged great and long Wars, and had overcome and reduced
the <i>Saxons</i> to Terms of Submission) finding a fit Occasion to
assume the Regal Title which was offer'd him, did not let it slip:
Especially seeing himself at the Head of a great and victorious
Army, that espoused his Interests. Of which we have the Testimony
of many Authors. First, <i>Otto Frisingius</i>, Chron. 5. cap. 12.
and his Transcriber <i>Godf. Viterb.</i> Part. 16. who write
thus.&mdash;"The Kings of <i>France</i>, before the Time of
<i>Pipin the Great</i>, (formerly <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>) were
in a Manner but titular Princes, having very little to do with the
Government of the Realm." <i>Sigebertus</i> says almost the same
Thing <i>sub Anno</i> 662.&mdash;"From this Time, (says he) the
Kings of the <i>Franks</i> degenerating from their ancient Wisdom
and Fortitude, enjoy'd little more than the bare Name of King. They
did indeed bear the Title according to Custom, <i>as being of the
ancient Regal Race</i>; but neither acted nor disposed of any
Thing: The whole Administration and Power of the Kingdom, was
lodg'd in the Hands of the <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>."</p>

<p>Yet in Reading such-like Authorities, we ought to take this
Observation along with us. That since <i>Pipin</i> and his Sons
laboured (as 'tis probable they did) under a great Load of Envy,
for having violently wrested the Royal Dignity from King
<i>Childerick</i>, they made it their Business to find out and
employ <i>plausible ingenious Historians</i>, who magnified the
Cowardliness of <i>Childerick</i> and his Predecessors, upbraiding
them with Sloth and Idleness, beyond what they deserv'd. And among
such as these, we may reckon <i>Eguinarthus</i>, Chancellor to
<i>Charles</i> the <i>Great</i>, and one that did him special
Service of this Nature; who in the Beginning of his Book writes
thus.&mdash;"The Family of the <i>Merovingians</i>, out of which
the <i>Franks</i> used to <i>Elect</i> their Kings, is supposed to
have lasted as long as to <i>Hilderic</i>; who by the Appointment
of Pope <i>Stephen</i>, was deposed, shaven, and thrust into a
Monastery. Now tho' it may be said to have ended in him, yet in
Truth, for a long Time before, it ceased to have any Value or
Excellency, bearing the bare empty Title of King. For both the
Riches and Power of the Kingdom, were at the Disposition of the
<i>Prefects of the Palace</i>, commonly called <i>Majores
Domus</i>; with whom was also lodg'd the Authority of the Empire:
Neither was there any Thing left remaining to the King, but only
that contenting himself with the Title, he should sit on a Throne,
wearing his Hair and Beard very long, and representing the Person
of a Ruler; sometimes giving the first and last Audience to
Ambassadors from Foreign Parts, and returning such Answers as were
made for him, as if they proceeded immediately from himself. But
besides the unprofitable Name of a King, and a precarious Allowance
for his private Expences, (which the Mayor of the Palace was
pleased out of Bounty to give him) he had nothing that he could
call his own, except one Village of very small Revenue, where he
had a little House, and a few Servants, barely sufficient for his
necessary Occasions, &amp;c."</p>

<p><i>Sigebertus, sub Anno 662.</i> taking <i>Eguinarthus</i> for
his Pattern, inveighs against the former Kings in almost the same
contumelious Terms. "Whose Custom (says he) it was, indeed, to make
an Appearance like a Prince, according to what had been usual to
their Family; but neither to act, nor dispose of any thing, only to
tarry at Home, and to Eat and Drink like Irrational
Creatures."&mdash;As if the like Sloth and Cowardise ought to be
imputed to all the former Kings, among whom we nevertheless find
many brave Men, such as <i>Clodoveus</i>, who not only defeated a
great Army of <i>Germans</i>, which had made an Irruption into
<i>France</i>, in a great Battel near <i>Tolbiacum</i>; but also
drove the Remainder of the <i>Romans</i> out of the Confines of
<i>Gallia</i>. What shall we say of <i>Childebert</i> and
<i>Clotharius</i>, who rooted the <i>Visigoths</i> and
<i>Ostrogoths</i> out of <i>Provence</i> and <i>Aquitain</i>, where
they had seated themselves? In the Histories of all which Princes,
there is no Mention made of any <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>, but
cursorily, and by the By, as one of the <i>King's Servants</i>.
This we may see in <i>Gregorius</i>, lib 5. cap. 18, where he
speaks of <i>Gucilius</i>, <i>Lib. 6. cap. 9.</i> and <i>cap.
45</i>. <i>Lib. 7. cap. 49</i>. And we find this Employment to have
been not only in the <i>King's</i> Palace, but also in the
<i>Queen's</i>: For the same <i>Gregorius</i>, lib. 7. cap. 27.
mentions one <i>Waddo</i> as <i>Mayor</i> of the <i>Palace</i>, in
the Court of <i>Queen Riguntha</i>: And in very many other Places
of their Histories, we find both <i>Gregorius</i> and
<i>Aimoinus</i> making Mention of these <i>Masters of the Court</i>
and <i>the King's House</i>.</p>

<p>Now the first Beginning of the great Authority of these
<i>Pr&aelig;fecti Regii</i>, was (as we told you before) during the
Reign of King <i>Clotharius</i> the Second, about the Year of our
Lord 588. that is, about 130 Years after the constituting the
<i>Francogallican Kingdom</i>; which we may also learn from the
before-mention'd Historian, so often quoted by
<i>Venericus</i>.</p>

<p>Yet there are two other Historians, (tho' not of equal Credit)
<i>Sigibertus</i> and <i>Trithemius</i>, who refer the Beginning of
so great a Power in the <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>, to the Reign of
<i>Clotair</i> the Third; whose <i>Magister Palatii</i> was one
<i>Ebroinus</i>, a Man of extraordinary Wickedness and Cruelty: But
however this may be, we find Historians calling them by several
other Appellations; such as <i>Comites Domus Regie, Pr&aelig;fecti
Aul&aelig;, Comites Palatii, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<p class="one"><i>Whether</i> Pipin <i>was created King by the</i>
Pope, <i>or by the Authority of the</i> Francogallican Council.</p>

<p>Having in the former Chapter given an Account, that after the
Expulsion of <i>Childerick</i>, (a stupid Prince, in whom the Line
of the Merovingians ended) <i>Pipin</i>, from being <i>Mayor of the
Palace</i>, was created <i>King</i>; It will be worth our Enquiry,
to know by whose Authority the Kingdom was conferr'd upon him. For
<i>Pope Gelasius</i> says thus, <i>Cap. 75. Quest. 6.</i> &mdash;"<i>A
Roman Pope</i>, viz. <i>Zacharias</i>, deposed the King of the
<i>Franks</i>, not so much because of his evil Actions, as because
he was stupid, and unfit for the Exercise of so great a Trust; and
in his Stead, substituted <i>Pipin</i>, Father of <i>Charles</i>
the Emperor: Absolving all the <i>Franks</i> from the Oath of
Allegiance to <i>Childeric</i>."</p>

<p>And there is scarce an Author who does not acquiesce in this
Testimony of one <i>Pope</i>, concerning the Power of another: Thus
<i>Ado, Lambertus, Rhegino, Sigibertus, Aimoinus, Landulphus</i>,
nay, even <i>Venericus Vercellensis</i>, (in the Book which we
formerly quoted) cites these Words out of the Epistle of <i>Pope
Gregory</i> the VIIth. to <i>Herman</i> Bishop or <i>Metz</i>; viz.
"A certain <i>Pope of Rome deposed</i> the <i>King</i> of the
<i>Franks</i> from his Kingdom, nor so much for his Wickedness, as
his being unfit for so great a Power; and after having absolved all
the <i>Franks</i> from the Oath of Fidelity they had sworn to him,
placed <i>Pipin</i> in his Room.&mdash;Which <i>Otto
Frisingius</i>, lib. Chron. 5. cap. 23. and <i>Godfrey</i>, Chron.
Part. 17. laying presently hold of, break out into this
Exclamation&mdash;From this Action, the Popes of <i>Rome</i> derive
an Authority of changing and deposing Princes, &amp;c."</p>

<p>But pray let us enquire whether the Truth of this Story, as to
the Matter of Fact, be sufficiently proved and attested. For in the
first Place, 'tis manifest, That <i>not one</i> of all that
<i>great Number of Kings</i> of the <i>Franks</i>, which we have
instanced to have been Elected or Abdicated, was either created or
abdicated by the Pope's Authority. On the contrary we have
irrefragably prov'd, that the whole Right, both of <i>making</i>
and <i>deposing</i> their Kings, was lodg'd in the yearly <i>great
Council</i> of the Nation; so that it seems incredible the
<i>Franks</i> shou'd neglect or forgo their Right, in this single
Instance of <i>Pipin</i>. But to make few Words of this Matter,
<i>Venericus Vercellensis</i> gives us the Testimony of an ancient
Historian, who has written of all the <i>Francogallican</i>
Affairs; whereby that whole Story of the <i>Pope</i>, is prov'd to
be a Lye: And 'tis clearly demonstrated, that both
<i>Childerick</i> was deposed, and <i>Pipin</i> chosen in his room,
according to the <i>usual</i> Custom of the <i>Franks</i>, and the
<i>Institutions</i> of our Ancestors: That is to say, by a
<i>solemn General Council of the Nation</i>; in whose Power
<i>only</i> it was, to transact a Matter of so great Weight and
Moment; as we have before made it appear. The Words of that
Historian are these:&mdash;"That by the <i>Counsel</i>, and with
the <i>Consent</i> of all the <i>Franks</i>, (a Relation of this
Affair being sent to the Apostolick See, and its Advice had) the
most noble <i>Pipin</i> was advanced to the Throne of the Kingdom,
<i>By the Election of the whole Nation</i>, the Homage of the
Nobility, with the Consecration of the Bishops, &amp;c." From which
Words, 'tis most apparent that <i>Pipin</i> was not appointed King
by the <i>Pope</i>, but by the <i>People themselves</i>, and the
<i>States of the Realm</i>. And <i>Venericus</i> explains this
Matter out of the same Historian. "<i>Pipin, Mayor</i> of the
Palace (says he) having all along had the Administration of the
Regal Power in his Hands, was the first that was appointed and
elected to be King, from being <i>Mayor of the Palace</i>; the
<i>Opinion</i> of <i>Pope Zachary</i> being first known, because
the Consent and <i>Countenance</i> of a Pope of <i>Rome</i>, was
thought necessary in an Affair of this Nature."&mdash;And presently
after he tells us; "The Pope finding that what the Ambassadors had
deposed was just and profitable, agreed to it; and <i>Pipin</i> was
made King by the unanimous Suffrages and Votes of the Nobility,
&amp;c."&mdash;To the very same Purpose writes <i>Ado of
Vienna</i>, &AElig;tat. 6. <i>sub Anno 727.</i>&mdash;"Ambassadors (says
he) were sent to Pope <i>Zacharias</i>, to propose this Question to
him; Whether or no the Kings of the <i>Franks</i>, who had scarce
any <i>Power</i> in their Hands, but contented themselves with the
bare <i>Title</i>, were fit to continue to be <i>Kings</i>?" To
which <i>Zacharias</i> return'd this Answer,&mdash;"That he thought
the <i>Person who governed</i> the Commonwealth, ought rather to
have also the <i>Title</i> of King: Whereupon the <i>Franks</i>,
after the Return of the Ambassadors, cast out <i>Childeric</i>, who
then had the Title of King; and by the <i>Advice</i> of the
<i>Ambassadors</i>, and of Pope <i>Zacharias, Elected Pipin</i>,
and made him King."</p>

<p>Besides the above Proofs, we have <i>Aimoinus's</i> Testimony to
the same Purpose, <i>lib. 4. cap. 61</i>. where he concludes
thus.&mdash;"This Year <i>Pipin</i> got the Appellation of King of
the <i>Franks</i>, and according to their ancient Customs was
elevated to the Royal Throne in the City of <i>Soissons</i>,
&amp;c." Nay, even <i>Godfrey of Viterbo</i> himself; <i>Chron.
part. 17. cap. 4.</i> "<i>Pipin</i> (says he) was made King by Pope
<i>Zacharias</i>, (<i>ex electione Francorum</i>) through the
<i>Election</i> of the <i>Franks</i>, <i>Hilderic</i> their
slothful King being, by the <i>Franks</i>, thrust into a
Monastery."</p>

<p>In like Manner <i>Sigebertus</i>, sub Anno 752.&mdash; The
Authors of the <i>Miscellany History</i>, lib. 22. &mdash;<i>Otto
Frising</i>. lib. 5. Cap. 21, 22, 23. And the Author of the Book
intituled <i>Fasciculus temperum</i>, do all clearly agree in the
Account given of this Transaction. From which we may easily gather,
that altho' the <i>Franks</i> did <i>consult</i> the <i>Pope</i>
before they created <i>Pipin</i> King, yet it cannot therefore be
any Ways inferr'd from thence, that he was made King by the
<i>Pope's Authority</i>; for 'tis one Thing to make a King, and
another to give Advice touching the making him: 'Tis one Thing to
have a Right of Creation, and another that of only giving Advice;
nay; no Man has a Right of so much as giving Advice in Matters of
this Nature, but he whose Advice is first ask'd.</p>

<p>Lastly, no Man has more clearly explain'd this whole Matter than
<i>Marsilius Patavinus</i>; who during the Reign of <i>Lewis</i> of
<i>Bavaria</i>, writ a Book&mdash;<i>de translatione imperii</i>,
in which, <i>Cap. 6.</i> he has these Words.&mdash;"<i>Pipin</i>, a
very valiant Man, and Son of <i>Charles Martel</i>, was (as we
read) raised to the Dignity of being King of the <i>Franks</i>, by
<i>pope Zacharias</i>. But <i>Aimoinus</i> more truly informs us,
in his History of the <i>franks</i>, that <i>Pipin</i> was
<i>legally elected</i> King by the <i>Franks</i> themselves, and by
the Nobility of the Kingdom was placed in the Throne. At the same
Time <i>Childeric</i>, a dissolute Prince, who contenting himself
with the bare Title of a King, wasted both his Time and Body in
Wantonness, was by them shaven for a Monk: So that <i>Zacharias</i>
had no Hand in the deposing him, but consented (as some say) to
those that did. For such deposing of a King for just Causes, and
and electing of another, does not belong to any Bishop or
Ecclesiastick, nor to any College of Clergymen; but to the <i>whole
Body of citizens</i> [ad universitatem civium] inhabiting that
Region, and to the Nobles of it, or to the Majority of them both."
Therefore those Pretences of the <i>Popes</i>, to a Power of
<i>creating</i> or <i>abdicating</i> Kings, are apparently false to
every Body. But besides this fabulous Device, which is a sufficient
Instance of their Wickedness and Malice, I think it worth my while
to add a remarkable Letter of Pope <i>Stephen</i>, adapted to the
foregoing Fable; by which we may make a judgment of the Madness and
folly of that old crafty Knave. This Letter is extant in
<i>Rhegino</i>, a Benedictine Monk, and Abbot of <i>Prunay</i>,
[Footnote: <i>Abbot Pruniacensis</i>] an irrefragable Testimony in
an Affair of this Nature; 'tis in <i>Chron. anni</i> 753.
&mdash;"<i>Stephen</i> the Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God,
&amp;c. As no Man ought to boast of his Merits, so neither ought
the wonderful Works of God which are wrought upon his Saints
without their Desert, to be buried in Silence, but published abroad
as the Angel admonished <i>Tobias</i>. I being constrained thro'
the Oppression of the holy Church, by that most wicked,
blasphemous, and not worthy to be named Wretch, <i>Aistolphus</i>,
to fly for Refuge to that <i>excellent and faithful Votary of
St.</i> Peter, <i>Lord</i> Pipin, the most <i>Christian</i> King,
took my Journey into <i>France</i>; where I fell into a mortal
Distemper and remained some Time in the District of <i>Paris</i>,
in the venerable Monastery of St. <i>Denis</i> the Martyr. And
being now past Hopes of Recovery, methought I was one Day at
Prayers in the Church of the same blessed Martyr, in a Place under
the Bells: And that I saw standing before the great Altar our
Master <i>Peter</i>; and that great Master of the <i>Gentiles</i>,
our Master <i>Paul</i>; whom I knew very well by their Vestments.
And a little after, I saw the blessed <i>Lord Denis</i>, a tall and
slender Man, standing at the Right Hand of our Lord <i>Peter</i>.
And then that good Pastor the Lord <i>Peter</i> said&mdash;This
good Brother of ours asks for Health. Then reply'd the blessed
<i>Paul</i>&mdash;He shall be healed presently. And thereupon
approaching to our Lord <i>Denis</i>, he amicably put his Hand upon
his Breast, and look'd back upon our Lord <i>Peter</i>, and Lord
<i>Peter</i> with a chearful Countenance said to our Lord
<i>Denis</i>, His Health shall be your particular Act of Favour.
Then presently Lord <i>Denis</i> taking a Censer full of Incense,
and holding a Branch of Palm-tree in his Hand, accompanied with a
Presbyter and Deacon, who assisted him, came near to me, and said,
Peace be with thee, Brother, be not afraid, thou shalt not die
until thou return in Prosperity to thy own See. Rise and be healed,
and dedicate this Altar to the Honour of God, and the Apostles St.
<i>Peter</i> and St. <i>Paul</i>, whom thou seest standing before
thee, with Masses of Thanksgiving. Whereupon I was presently made
whole. And being about to accomplish that which I was commanded to
do, they that were present said I was mad. So I related all that I
had seen, to them, to the King, and all his People, and how I had
been cured; and I fulfilled all that I was bid to do. These Things
happen'd in the 753d Year, from the Incarnation of our Lord on the
Ides of <i>August</i>; at which Time being strengthned by the Power
of <i>Christ</i>, between the Celebration of the Consecration of
the above-mention'd Altar, and the Oblation of the Sacrifice, I
anointed King <i>Pipin</i> and his two Sons, <i>Charles</i> and
<i>Carloman</i>, Kings of the <i>Franks</i>. Moreover, I laid Hands
upon, and blessed <i>Bertranda</i> the King's Wife, cloathed with
her Royal Mantle, and the Grace of the Sevenfold Holy Spirit: And
the Nobles of the <i>Franks</i> being sanctified by the Apostolical
Benediction, and the Authority delivered by <i>Christ</i> to St.
<i>Peter</i>, obliged themselves solemnly, and protested, That
neither they, nor any of their Posterity, wou'd at any Time
hereafter, presume to constitute any Person, as King over them, but
only such as were of the Race of King <i>Pipin</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV" id="CHAP_XIV" />CHAP. XIV.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> Constable, <i>and</i> Peers <i>of</i>
France.</p>

<p>Besides the great Office of <i>Mayor</i> of the <i>Palace</i>
before spoken of, there was another which we must take Notice of;
because it seems, in the Memory of our Forefathers, to have
succeeded in Place of the former: And that was the Office of
<i>Count</i> of the <i>King's Stable</i>; called at first, <i>Comes
stabuli</i>; and by Corruption at last, <i>Connestabuli</i>. Now
all those who enjoy'd any extraordinary Honours or Employments in
the King's Court, and assisted in the Administration of the
Commonwealth, were commonly called <i>Comites, Counts</i>; which
was likewise the Custom of the Ancients, as I have in some other of
my Works demonstrated. So <i>Cicero</i>, in many Places, calls
<i>Callisthenes, Comitem Alexandri magni</i>. This <i>Comes
stabuli</i> was in a Manner the same with the <i>Magister
Equitum</i> among the <i>Romans</i>, that is, <i>General</i> of the
<i>Horse</i>; to whom were subject those Keepers of the Horses
commonly called <i>Querries</i>. <i>Greg. Turen</i> lib. 5. cap.
39. says,&mdash;"The Treasurer of <i>Clodoveus</i> being taken out
of the City of <i>Bourges</i>, by <i>Cuppan</i>, <i>Count</i> of
the <i>Stable</i>, was sent in Bonds to the Queen, &amp;c." And
again, <i>cap.</i> 48. where he speaks of
<i>Leudastes</i>,&mdash;"She took him (says he) into Favour, rais'd
him, and made him Keeper of the best Horses; which so filled him
with Pride and Vanity, that he put in for the <i>Constableship</i>;
[<i>Comitatum Stabuloram</i>] and having got it, began to despise
and undervalue every Body." From these Quotations it appears, that
tho' the Custody of the Horses was a very honourable Employment,
yet 'twas much inferior to that of <i>Constable</i>.
<i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 3. cap. 43. gives the same Account of this
<i>Leudastes</i>.&mdash;"Being grown very intimate with the Queen,
he was first made Keeper of the Horse; and afterwards obtaining the
Constableship above the rest of the Keepers, he was (after the
Queen's Death) made by King <i>Charibert</i>, <i>Count</i> of
<i>Tours</i>." And <i>cap.</i> 70. "<i>Leudegesilus</i>, Pr&aelig;fect
of the King's Horses, whom they commonly call <i>Constable</i>,
being made General of that Expedition by the King, order'd the
Engines to be drawn down &amp;c." Also <i>lib.</i> 4. <i>cap</i>,
95. where he speaks of <i>Charles</i> the Great,&mdash;"The same
Year (says he) he sent <i>Burchard, Comitem Stabuli sui</i>, which
we corruptly call <i>Constabulum</i>, with a Fleet against
<i>Corsica</i>"&mdash;. The Appendix to <i>Gregory</i> calls him,
<i>Comestabulum, lib.</i> II. <i>Brunechildis</i> (says he) was
brought out of the Village, <i>ab exporre Comestabulo</i>.</p>

<p>This being so, <i>Albertus Krantzius</i>, lib. Suet. 5. cap. 41.
ventures to affirm, that this <i>Constable</i> was the same with
what the <i>Germans</i> call <i>Mareschal</i>. "They named (says
he) a <i>Governor</i>, one of the best Soldiers, who might have the
Power of Convocating the <i>Assembly</i> of the Kingdom, and of
acting in all Matters like the <i>Prince</i>. Our <i>Countrymen</i>
call him a <i>Mareschal</i>, the French call him <i>Constable</i>,
&amp;c." This seems the more probable, because I do not remember
any Mention to have been made in ancient Times, of a
<i>Mareschal</i> in our <i>Francogallia</i>; so that 'tis very
likely to have been an Institution of our latter Kings,
accommodated to the Custom of the <i>Germans</i>.</p>

<p>That this <i>Comitatus Stabulorum</i>, a <i>Constableship</i>,
had its Rise from the Institution of the <i>Roman Emperors</i>, I
do not at all question; altho' it grew by Degrees among us from
slender Beginnings, to the Heighth of chief <i>Governor</i> of the
<i>Palace</i>. In former Times that Dignity was a Sort of
<i>Tribunatus Militaris. Ammianus</i>, lib. 26. has this Expression
where he speaks of <i>Valentinian</i> the Emperor,&mdash;"Having
fixed his Stages, or Days Journeys, he at last entred into
<i>Nicomedia</i>; and about the Kalends of <i>March</i>, appointed
his Brother <i>Valens</i> to be Governor of his Stables, <i>cum
tribunatus dignitate</i>, with <i>tribunitial Dignity</i>." What
Kind of Dignity that was, we may find in the Code of
<i>Justinian</i>, lib. 1. Cod. <i>de comitibus &amp; tribunis
Schol</i>. Where 'tis reckoned as a great Honour for them to
preside over the Emperor's Banquets, when they might adore his
Purple. Also in <i>lib. 3. Cod. Theodos. de annon. &amp; tribut,
perpensa, 29. Cod. Theod. de equorum Collatione &amp; lib. 1. Cod.
Theod.</i> wherein we may find a Power allowed them, of exacting
Contribution to a certain Value from the Provincials who were to
furnish War-Horses for the Emperor's Service.</p>

<p>It now remains that we discourse a little of those Magistrates,
which were commonly called <i>Peers</i> of <i>France</i>; whereof
we can find no Records or Monuments, tho' our Endeavours have not
been wanting. For among so great a Number of Books, as are called
Chronicles and Annals of <i>Francogallia</i>, not one affords us
any probable Account of this Institution. For what <i>Gaguinus</i>,
and <i>Paulus &AElig;milius</i> (who was not so much an Historian
of <i>French</i> Affairs, as of the <i>Pope's</i>) and other common
Writers do affirm, to wit, That those Magistrates were instituted
by <i>Pipin</i> or <i>Charlemagn</i>, appears plainly to be absurd;
because not one of all the <i>German</i> Historians, who wrote
during the Reigns of those Kings, or for some Time after, makes the
least Mention of those Magistrates. <i>Aimoinus</i> himself who
wrote a History of the Military Atchievements and Institutions of
the <i>Franks</i>, down to the Reign of <i>Lewis the Pious</i>, and
the <i>Appendix</i>, which reaches as far as the Time of <i>Lewis
the Younger</i>, being the 37th King, speak not one Word of these
<i>Peers</i> in any Place of their Histories; so that till I am
better inform'd, I must concur in Opinion with <i>Gervase</i> of
<i>Tilbury</i>, who (as <i>Gaguinus</i> says in the Book which he
wrote to the Emperor <i>Otho</i> the IVth, <i>de otiis
imperialibus</i>) affirms. That this Institution is first owing to
King <i>Arthur</i> of <i>Britain</i>, who ruled some time in Part
of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>For I suppose the Original of that Institution to be this; that
as in the <i>Feudal</i> Law such are called, <i>Pares curie
beneficiari</i>, i. e. <i>equal Tenants by Homage of the Court</i>,
or <i>Clientes,
&#8001;&mu;&#972;&tau;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&iota; Clients of like
holding</i>, or <i>Convassilli, Fellow Vassals</i>, who hold their
<i>Fiefs</i> and <i>Benefices</i> from one and the same <i>Lord</i>
and <i>Patron</i>; and upon that Account are bound to him in
<i>Fealty</i> and Obedience: just so King <i>Arthur</i> having
acquired a new Principality, selected <i>twelve great Men</i>, to
whom he distributed the several Parts and <i>Satrapies</i> of his
Kingdom, whole Assistance and Advice he made use of in the
Administration of the Government. For I cannot approve of their
Judgment, who write, that they were called <i>Peers</i>, because
they were <i>Pares Regi</i>, the <i>King's Equals</i>; since their
Parity his no Relation to the <i>Regal Dignity</i>, but only to
that Authority and Dignity they had agreed should be common among
them. Their Names were these, the <i>Dukes of Burgundy,
Normandy</i>, and <i>Aquitain</i>; the <i>Counts</i> of
<i>Flanders, Tholouse</i>, and <i>Champagne</i>; the
<i>Archbishops</i> of <i>Rheims, Laon</i>, and <i>Langres</i>; the
<i>Bishops</i> of <i>Beauvais, Noyon</i>, and <i>Chalons</i>. And
as the <i>Pares Curtis</i>, or <i>Curi&aelig;</i>, in the <i>Feudal</i>
Law, can neither be created, but by the Consent of the Fraternity;
nor <i>abdicated</i>, but by Tryal before their Colleagues; nor
<i>impeach'd</i> before any other Court of Judicature; so these
<i>Peers</i> were not bound by any judgment or Sentence, but that
of the <i>Parliament</i>, that is, of this imaginary Council; nor
could be <i>elected</i> into the <i>Society</i>, or <i>ejected</i>
out of it, but by their <i>Fellows in Collegio</i>.</p>

<p>Now altho' this Magistracy might owe its Original to a foreign
Prince; yet when he was driven out, the succeeding Kings finding it
accommodated to their own Ends and Conveniences, ('tis most
probable) continued and made use of it. The first mention I find
made of these <i>Peers</i>, was at the Inauguration of <i>Philip
the Fair</i>, by whom also (as many affirm) the Six
<i>Ecclestastical Peers</i> were first created.</p>

<p>But <i>Bud&aelig;us</i>, an extraordinary Learned Man, calls these
<i>Peers</i> by the Name of <i>Patritians</i>; and is of Opinion
that they were instituted by one of our Kings, who was at the same
Time <i>Emperor</i> of <i>Germany</i>; because, <i>Justinian</i>
says, those <i>Patres</i> were chosen by the <i>Emperor</i>,
<i>quasi Reipub. patronos tutoresque</i>, as it were <i>Patrons</i>
and <i>Tutors</i> of the Commonwealth. I do not reject this Opinion
of that Learned Person; such a Thing being very agreeable to the
Dignity of these <i>Peers</i>. For in the Times of the later
<i>Roman Emperors</i>, we find the <i>Patritian</i> Dignity not to
have been very unlike that of the <i>Peers</i>; because (as
<i>Suidas</i> assures us,) they were (partly) the <i>Fathers of
the</i> Republick, and were of <i>Council</i> with the Emperor in
all weighty Concerns, and made use of the same Ensigns of Authority
with the <i>Consuls</i>; and had greater Honour and Power than the
<i>Pr&aelig;fectus Pr&aelig;torio</i>, tho' less than the <i>Consul</i>; as
we may learn <i>ex Justiniani Novellis</i>; from <i>Sidon. Apollin.
Claudian</i>; and <i>Cassiadorus</i> especially.</p>

<p>But when the <i>Empire</i> was transferr'd to the
<i>Germans</i>, we do not believe this Honour was in use among
them. Neither is it likely, that none of the <i>German</i>
Historians should have made the least Mention of it, if any
<i>Patritians</i> of that Kind had been instituted by a
<i>German</i> Emperor, who at the same Time was King of
<i>Francogallia</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, The same <i>Bad&aelig;us</i> tells us in that Place, tho' a
little doubtingly, that the like Dignity of <i>Peers</i> had been
made use of in other neighbouring Nations; and that in the <i>Royal
Commentaries, Anno</i> 1224, 'tis found written, that a certain
Gentleman of <i>Flanders</i>, called <i>Joannes Nigellanus</i>,
having, a Controversy there, appeal'd from the <i>Countess</i> of
<i>Flanders</i> to the <i>Peers</i> of <i>France</i>; having first
taken his Oath that he could not expect a fair and equal Tryal
before the <i>Peers</i> of <i>Flanders</i>. And when afterwards the
Cause was by the <i>Countess</i> revok'd to the judgment of the
<i>Peers</i> of <i>Flanders</i>, it was at Length for certain
Reasons decreed, that the <i>Peers</i> of <i>France</i> should take
Cognisance of it. What the Reasons were of transferring, that
Tryal, <i>Bud&aelig;us</i> does not tell us; which one versed in the
<i>Feudal</i> Laws should never have omitted. But 'tis Time to
return to our principal Business.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XV" id="CHAP_XV" />CHAP. XV.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> continued <i>Authority and Power of
the</i> Sacred Council, <i>during the Reign of the</i> Carlovingian
<i>Family</i>.</p>

<p>We have, as we suppose, sufficiently explain'd what was the Form
and Constitution of our Commonwealth, and how great the Authority
of the <i>Publick Council</i> was during the Reigns of the Kings of
the <i>Merovingian</i> Family. We must now proceed to give an
Account of it under the <i>Carlovingian</i> Race. And as well all
our <i>own</i> as the <i>German</i> Historians, give us Reason to
believe that the very same <i>Power</i> and <i>Authority</i> of the
<i>Orders</i> or <i>States</i> of the Kingdom, was kept entire. So
that the last Resort and Disposal of all Things, was not lodged in
<i>Pipin</i>, <i>Charles</i>, or <i>Lewis</i>, but in the <i>Regal
Majesty</i>. The true and proper Seat of which was (as is above
demonstrated) in the <i>Annual General Council</i>. Of this
<i>Eguinarthus</i> gives us an Account, in that little Book we have
already so much commended. Where, speaking of what happen'd after
the Death of <i>Pipin</i>, he tells us, "that the <i>Franks</i>
having solemnly assembled their general Convention, did therein
constitute both <i>Pipin</i>'s Sons their Kings, upon this
Condition, That they should equally divide the whole Body of the
Kingdom between them; and that <i>Charles</i> should govern that
Part of it which their Father <i>Pipin</i> had possess'd, and
<i>Carlomannus</i> the other Part which their Uncle
<i>Carlomannus</i> had enjoy'd, &amp;c." From whence 'tis easily
inferr'd, that the <i>States</i> of the Kingdom still retain'd in
themselves the same Power, which they had always hitherto been in
Possession of (during near 300 Years) in the Reigns of the
<i>Merovingian</i> Kings. So that altho' the deceased King left
Sons behind him, yet there <i>came not</i> to the Crown so much
thro' any <i>Right of Succession</i>, as thro' the
<i>Appointment</i> and <i>Election</i> of the <i>States</i> of the
<i>Realm</i>. Now that all the other weighty Affairs of the Nation
used to be determined by the same <i>General Council</i>,
<i>Aimoinus</i> is our Witness, <i>lib.</i> 4. <i>cap.</i> 71.
where he speaks of the War with the <i>Saxons</i>. "The King (says
he) in the Beginning of the Spring went to <i>Nimeguen</i>; and
because he was to hold a General Convention of his People at a
Place called <i>Paderburn</i>, he marched from thence with a great
Army into <i>Saxony</i>." And again, <i>cap.</i> 77.&mdash;"Winter
being over, he held a Publick Convention of his People in a Town
called <i>Paderburn</i>, according to the <i>yearly Custom</i>."
Also <i>cap.</i> 79.&mdash; "And meeting with his Wife in the City
of <i>Wormes</i>, he resolved to hold there the <i>General
Council</i> of his People." In all which Places he speaks of that
<i>Charles</i>, who thro' his warlike Atchievements had acquired
the Dominion of almost all <i>Europe</i>, and by the universal
Consent of Nations had obtained the Sirname of the <i>Great</i>:
Yet for all that it was not in his Power to deprive the
<i>Franks</i> of their <i>ancient Right and Liberty</i>. Nay, he
never so much as endeavour'd to undertake the least Matter of
Moment without the <i>Advice</i> and <i>Authority</i> of his
<i>People</i> and <i>Nobles</i>. And there is no doubt of it, after
<i>Charles</i>'s Death, <i>Lewis</i> his Son administred the
Kingdom upon the same Terms and Conditions. For the <i>Appendix</i>
to <i>Aimoinus</i>, lib. 5. cap. 10. tells us, that when
<i>Charles</i> was dead, <i>Lewis</i> the Emperor, thro' a certain
Kind of Foreknowledge, summon'd the general Council of his People
to meet at <i>Doue</i>, near the <i>Loire</i>. And again,
<i>cap.</i> 38. where he makes Mention of the Articles of Peace,
concluded between King <i>Lewis</i> and his Cousin <i>Lewis</i>,
"&mdash;They summoned, says he, a PLACITUM, and in that PLACITUM,
by the Advice and Consent of their faithful Subjects, they agreed
to observe and keep the Articles which follow. In which
<i>Placitum</i> it was also by common Consent found convenient,
that both Kings should return with a Guard [<i>redirent cum
scar&acirc;</i>] <i>&amp;c</i>." Also <i>cap.</i> 41. where he
speaks of <i>Carloman</i> the Son of <i>Lewis the
Stammerer</i>,&mdash; "And so (says he) he departed from the
<i>Normans</i>, and returned to <i>Wormes</i>, where he was on the
Kalends of <i>November</i> to <i>hold his Placitum</i>." Also in
the following Chapter, where he speaks of <i>Charles</i> the
Simple,&mdash;"Whose Youth (says he) the great Men of <i>France</i>
thinking unfit for the Administration of the Government, they held
a <i>Council</i> concerning the State of the Nation."</p>

<p>But it would be an infinite Labour, and indeed a superfluous
one, to quote all the Instances which might be given of this
Matter: From what we have already produced, I think 'tis apparent
to every man, that till <i>Charles</i> the <i>Simple</i>'s Reign,
that is, for more than 550 Years, the Judgment and Determination of
all the weighty Affairs of the Commonwealth, belonged to the
<i>great Assembly</i> of the <i>People</i>, or (as we now call it)
to the <i>Convention of the Estates</i>: And that this Institution
of our Ancestors was esteemed <i>sacred</i> and <i>inviolable</i>
during so many Ages. So that I cannot forbear admiring the
Confidence of some Modern Authors, who have had the Face to publish
in their Writings, That King <i>Pipin</i> was the first to whom the
Institution of the <i>Publick Council</i> is owing. Since
<i>Eguinarthus</i>, <i>Charles</i> the <i>Great</i>'s own
<i>Chancellor</i>, has most clearly proved, that it was the
constant Practice of the whole <i>Merovingian Line</i>, to hold
every Year the <i>Publick Convention</i> of the People on the
<i>Kalends</i> of <i>May</i>; and that the <i>Kings</i> were
carried to that Assembly in a Chariot or Waggon drawn by Oxen.</p>

<p>But to come to a Matter of greater Consequence, wherein the
Prudence and Wisdom of our Ancestors does most clearly shew it
self. Is it not apparent how great and manifest a Distinction they
made between the King and the Kingdom? For thus the Case stands.
The <i>King</i> is one principal Single <i>Person</i>; but the
<i>Kingdom</i> is the whole Body of the <i>Citizens</i> and
<i>Subjects</i>. "And <i>Ulpian</i> defines him to be a Traytor,
who is stirred up with a Hostile Mind against the Commonwealth, or
against the Prince." And in the <i>Saxon</i> Laws, <i>Tit.</i> 3.
'tis Written, "Whosoever shall contrive any Thing against the
Kingdom, or the King of the <i>Franks</i>, shall lose his
Head."&mdash;And again, "The King has the same Relation to the
Kingdom that a Father has to his Family; a Tutor to his Pupil; a
Guardian to his Ward; a Pilot to his Ship, or a General to his
Army."&mdash; As therefore a Pupil is not appointed for the Sake of
his Tutor, nor a Ship for the Sake of the Pilot, nor an Army for
the Sake of a General, but on the contrary, all these are made such
for the Sake of those they have in Charge: Even so the
<i>People</i> is not designed for the Sake of the <i>King</i>; but
the King is sought out and instituted for the Peoples Sake. For a
<i>People</i> can subsist without a King, and be governed by its
Nobility, or by it Self: But 'tis even impossible to conceive a
Thought of a <i>King</i> without a <i>People</i>. Let us consider
more Differences between them. A <i>King</i> as well as any private
Person is a Mortal Man. A <i>Kingdom</i> is perpetual, and
consider'd as immortal; as Civilians use to say, when they speak of
Corporations, and aggregate Bodies. A <i>King</i> may be a Fool or
Madman, like our <i>Charles</i> VI who gave away his Kingdom to the
<i>English</i>: Neither is there any Sort of Men more easily cast
down from a Sound State of Mind, through the Blandishments of
unlawful Pleasures and Luxury. But a <i>Kingdom</i> has within it
self a perpetual and sure Principle of Safety in the Wisdom of its
Senators, and of Persons well skill'd in Affairs. A <i>King</i> in
one Battel, in one Day may be overcome, or taken Prisoner and
carried away Captive by the Enemy; as it happen'd to St.
<i>Lewis</i>, to King <i>John</i>, and to <i>Francis</i> the First.
But a <i>Kingdom</i> though it has lost its <i>King</i>, remains
entire; and immediately upon such a Misfortune a Convention is
call'd, and proper Remedies are sought by the chief Men of the
Nation against the present Mischiefs; Which we know has been done
upon like Accidents. A <i>King</i>, either through Infirmities of
Age, of Levity of Mind, may not only be missed by some covetous,
rapacious or lustful Counsellor; may not only be seduced and
depraved by debauch'd Youths of Quality, or of equal Age with
himself; may be infatuated by a silly Wench, so far as to deliver
and fling up the Reins of Government wholly into her Power. Few
Persons, I suppose, are ignorant how many sad Examples we have of
these Mischiefs: But a <i>Kingdom</i> is continually supplied with
the Wisdom and Advice of the grave Persons that are in it.
<i>Solomon</i>, the wisest of Mankind, was in his old Age seduced
by Harlots; <i>Rehoboam</i>, by young Men; <i>Ninus</i>, by his own
Mother <i>Semiramis</i>; <i>Ptolom&aelig;us</i> sirnamed <i>Auletes</i>,
by <i>Harpers</i> and <i>Pipers</i>. Our Ancestors left to their
Kings the Choice of their own Privy-Counsellors, who might advice
them in the Management of their private Affairs; but such Senators
as were to consult in common, and take care of the publick
Administration, and instruct the King in the Government of his
Kingdom, they reserved to the Designation of the <i>Publick
Convention</i>.</p>

<p>In the Year 1356: after King <i>John</i> had been taken Prisoner
by the <i>English</i>, and carried into <i>England</i>, a Publick
Council of the Kingdom was held at <i>Paris</i>. And when some of
the King's Privy-Counsellors appeared at that Convention, they were
commanded to leave the Assembly; and it was openly declared, that
the Deputies of the Publick Council wou'd meet no more, if those
Privy-Counsellors shou'd hereafter presume to approach that
Sanctuary of the Kingdom. Which Instance is recorded in the Great
Chronicle writ in <i>French</i>, Vol. 2. <i>sub Rege Johanne</i>,
fol. 169. Neither has there ever yet been any Age wherein this
plain Distinction between a <i>King</i> and a <i>Kingdom</i>, has
not been observed. The <i>King</i> of the <i>Lacedemonians</i> (as
<i>Xenophon</i> assures us) and the <i>Ephori</i>, renewed <i>every
Month</i> a mutual <i>Oath</i> between each other; the <i>King</i>
swore that he wou'd govern according to the written Laws; and the
<i>Ephori</i> swore that they wou'd preserve the Royal Dignity,
provided he kept his Oath. <i>Cicero</i>, in one of his Epistles to
<i>Brutus</i>, writes: "Thou knowest that I was always of Opinion,
that our Commonwealth ought not only to be deliver'd from a
<i>King</i>, but even from <i>Kingship</i>, Scis mihi semper
placuisse non <i>Rege</i> folum, sed <i>Regno</i> liberari
rempublicam."&mdash;Also in his Third Book <i>de
Legibus</i>&mdash;"But because a Regal State in our Commonwealth,
once indeed approved of, was abolish'd, not so much upon the
Account of the Faults of a <i>Kingly</i> Government, as of the
<i>Kings</i> who governed; it may seem that only the Name of a
<i>King</i> was then abolish'd, &amp;c."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVI" id="CHAP_XVI" />CHAP. XVI.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> Capevingian <i>Race, and the Manner of
its obtaining the Kingdom of</i> Francogallia.</p>

<p>It has been already shewn, that the Kingdom of
<i>Francogallia</i> continued in Three Families only, during One
Thousand Two Hundred Years. Whereof the first was called the
<i>Merovingian</i> Family. The second, the <i>Carlovingian</i>,
from the Names of their Founders or Beginners. For altho' (as we
have often told you) the Succession to the Kingdom was not conferred
as <i>Hereditary</i> Right, but according to the Appointment of the
<i>General Council</i>; yet the <i>Franks</i> were so far willing
to retain the Custom of their Progenitors the <i>Germans</i>, (who
as <i>Tacitus</i> tells us, chuse their <i>Kings</i> for their
<i>Nobility</i>, and their <i>Generals</i> for their <i>Valour</i>)
that for the most Part they elected such Kings as were of the Blood
<i>Royal</i>, and had been educated in a Regal Manner, whether they
were the Children, or some other Degree of Kindred to the Royal
Family.</p>

<p>But in the Year 987, after the Death of <i>Lewis</i> the Fifth,
who was the 31st King of <i>Francogallia</i>, and the 12th of the
<i>Carlovingian</i> Line, there hapned a Migration or Translation
of the Royal Scepter, and a Change of the Kingdom. For when there
remained no Person alive of the former Family but <i>Charles Duke
of Lorrain</i>, Uncle to the deceased King, to whom the Succession
to the Kingdom, by ancient Custom seemed to be due; there arose up
one <i>Hugh Capet</i>, Nephew to <i>Hauvida</i>, Sister to the
Emperor <i>Otho</i> the First, and Son to <i>Hugh</i> Earl of
<i>Paris</i>; a Man of great Reputation for Valour, who alledged,
that he being present upon the Place, and having deserved
extraordinary well of his Country, ought to be preferred to a
Stranger, who was absent. For there having hapned some
Controversies between the <i>Empire of Germany</i>, and the Kingdom
of <i>France</i>; <i>Charles</i> upon Occasion had shewn himself
partial for the <i>Empire</i> against <i>France</i>, and upon that
Score had lost the Affections of most of the <i>French</i>.
Whereupon <i>Charles</i> having raised an Army, made an Irruption
into <i>France</i>, and took several Cities by Composition.
<i>Capet</i> relying on the Friendship and Favour of the
<i>Francogallican</i> Nobles, got together what Forces he cou'd,
and went to meet him at <i>Laon</i>, a Town in the Borders of
<i>Champagne</i>; and not long after a bloody Battel was fought
between them, wherein <i>Capet</i> was routed, and forced to fly
into the innermost Parts of <i>France</i>; where he began again to
raise Men in Order to renew the War. In the mean Time
<i>Charles</i> having dismiss'd his Army, kept himself quiet in the
Town of <i>Laon</i> with his Wife; but in the Year following he was
on a sudden surrounded by <i>Capet</i>, who besieged the Town with
a great Army.</p>

<p>There was in the Place one <i>Anselmus</i>, Bishop of the City.
<i>Capet</i> found Means to corrupt this Man by great Gifts and
Promises, and to induce him to betray both the Town and the King
into his Hands; which was accordingly done. And thus having
obtained both the City and the Victory, he sent <i>Charles</i> and
his Wife Prisoners to <i>Orleans</i>, where he set strict Guards
over them. The King having been two Years in Prison, had two Sons
born to him there, <i>Lewis</i> and <i>Charles</i>; but not long
after they all died. So that <i>Capet</i> being now Master of the
whole Kingdom of <i>France</i> without Dispute or Trouble,
associated his Son <i>Robert</i> with him in the Throne, and took
care to get him declared his Successor. Thus the Dignity and Memory
of the <i>Carlovingian</i> Family came to an End, the 237th Year
after the first Beginning of their Reign. And this History is
recorded by <i>Sigebert</i> in <i>Chron</i>. Ann. 987. as well as
the <i>Appendix</i>, lib. 5. cap. 45.</p>

<p>We must not omit making Mention of the <i>cunning Device</i>
made use of by <i>Hugh Capet</i>, for establishing himself in his
new Dominion: For whereas all the Magistracies and Honours of the
Kingdom, such as <i>Dukedoms, Earldoms</i>, &amp;c. had been
hitherto from ancient Times conferr'd upon select and deserving
Persons in the General <i>Conventions</i> of the <i>People</i>, and
were held only during good <i>behaviour</i>; whereof (as the
Lawyers express it) they were but <i>Beneficiaries</i>; <i>Hugh
Capet</i>, in order to secure to himself the Affections of the
Great Men, was the first that made those <i>Honours perpetual</i>,
which formerly were but <i>temporary</i>; and ordained, that such
as obtained them shou'd have a hereditary Right in them, and might
leave them to their Children and Posterity in like Manner as their
other Estates. Of this, see <i>Franciscus Conanus</i> the Civilian,
<i>Comment. 2. Cap. 9</i>. By which notorious fact, 'tis plain,
that a great Branch of the <i>Publick Council'</i>s Authority was
torn away; which however (to any Man who seriously considers the
Circumstances of those Times) seems impossible to have been
affected by him alone, without the Consent of that <i>Great
Council</i> it self.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVII" id="CHAP_XVII" />CHAP. XVII.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the uninterrupted Authority of the</i> Publick
Council <i>during the</i> Capevingian <i>Race</i>.</p>

<p>We may learn, out of <i>Froissard, Monstrellet, Gaguinus,
Commines, Gillius</i>, and all the other Historians who have
written concerning these Times, that the Authority of the Publick
Council was little or nothing less in the Time of the
<i>Capevingian</i> Family than it had been during the two former
Races. But because it would be too troublesome, and almost an
infinite Labour to quote every Instance of this Nature, we shall
only chose some few of the most remarkable Examples out of a vast
Number which we might produce.</p>

<p>And the first shall be, what hapned in the Year 1328. When
<i>Charles</i> the <i>Fair</i> dying without Issue Male, and
leaving a Posthumous Daughter behind him; <i>Edward</i> King of
<i>England</i>, and Son to <i>Isabella</i>, Sister of
<i>Charles</i>, claimed the Kingdom of <i>France</i> as belonging
to him of Right. Now there could be no Trial of greater Importance,
nor more illustrious, brought before the <i>Publick Council</i>,
than a Controversy of this Kind. And because it was decided there,
and both Kings did submit themselves to the Judgment and
Determination of the Council, 'tis an irrefragable Argument, that
the <i>Authority</i> of the <i>Council</i> was greater than that of
both Kings. This Fact is recorded not only by all our own
Historians, but by <i>Polydore Virgil</i> an <i>English</i> Writer,
<i>Histor. lib</i> 19. Moreover, that great Lawyer <i>Paponius</i>,
<i>Arrestorum</i>, lib. 4. cap. I. has left it on Record,
(grounded, no doubt, upon sufficient Authorities,) "That both Kings
were present at that <i>Council</i>, when the Matter was almost
brought to an open Rupture; by the Advice of the <i>Nobles</i>, a
<i>General Convention</i> of the <i>People</i> and <i>States</i>
was summon'd: and the <i>Vote of the Majority</i> was, that the
Kinsman, by the Father's Side, ought to have the Preference; and
that the Custody of the Queen, then great with Child, shou'd be
given to <i>Valois</i>; to whom also the Kingdom was
<i>adjudged</i> and <i>decreed</i> in Case she brought forth a
Daughter."&mdash;Which History <i>Froissard</i>, Vol. I. Cap. 22.
<i>Paponius</i> Arrest. lib. 4. cap. I. Art. 2. and <i>Gaguinus</i>
in <i>Philippo Valesio</i>, have published.</p>

<p>The Year 1356, furnishes us with another Example; at which Time
King <i>John</i> was defeated by the <i>English</i> at
<i>Poictiers</i>; taken Prisoner, and carried into
<i>England</i>.&mdash;"After so great a Calamity, the only Hopes
left were in the Authority of the <i>Great Council</i>; therefore
immediately a Parliament was summon'd to meet at <i>Paris</i>. And
altho' King <i>John</i>'s Three Sons, <i>Charles</i>, <i>Lewis</i>
and <i>John</i>, were at Hand, the eldest of which was of competent
Age to govern; yet other Men were chosen, to wit, <i>twelve
approved Persons</i> out of each <i>Order</i> of the <i>States</i>,
to whom the Management of the Kingdom's Affairs was intrusted; and
there it was decreed, that an Embassy shou'd be sent into
<i>England</i> to treat of Peace with the <i>English</i>."
<i>Froissard</i>, Vol. I. cap. 170. <i>Joannes Buchettus</i>, lib.
4. fol. 118. <i>Nich. Gillius</i> in Chron. <i>Regis Joannis</i>,
are our Authors.</p>

<p>A third Instance we have <i>Anno</i> 1375, when the last Will
and Testament of <i>Charles</i> the Fifth, Surnamed the
<i>Wise</i>, was produced: By which Will he had appointed his
Wife's Brother, <i>Philip</i> Duke of <i>Bourbon</i>, to be
Guardian to his Sons, and <i>Lewis</i> Duke of <i>Anjou</i> his own
Brother, to be Administrator of the Kingdom till such Time as his
Son <i>Charles</i> shou'd come of Age. But notwithstanding this, a
<i>Great Council</i> was held at <i>Paris</i>, wherein (after
declaring the Testament to be void and null) it was decreed, that
the <i>Administration</i> of the Kingdom shou'd be committed to
<i>Lewis</i>, the Boy's Uncle: "<i>But upon this Condition, that
he</i> should be <i>ruled and governed</i> in that
<i>Administration, by the Advice of certain Persons named and
approv'd by the</i> Council." The Education and Tutelage of the
Child was left to <i>Bourbon</i>; and at the same Time a Law was
made, that the Heir of the Kingdom shou'd be crown'd as soon as he
shou'd be full 14 Years old, and receive the Homage and Oath of
Fidelity from his Subjects.&mdash; <i>Froissard</i>, Vol. 2. cap.
60. <i>Buchett</i>, lib. 4. fol. 124. Chro. Brit. Cap.</p>

<p>A 4th Example we have in the Year 1392; at which Time the same
<i>Charles</i> the Sixth was taken with a sudden Distraction or
Madness, and was convey'd first to <i>Mans</i>, and afterwards to
<i>Paris</i>; and there a <i>General Council</i> was held, wherein
it was decreed by the <i>Authority of the States</i>, that the
<i>Administration</i> of the <i>Kingdom</i> shou'd be committed to
the Dukes of <i>Aquitain</i> and
<i>Burgundy</i>.&mdash;<i>Froissard</i>, Vol. 4. cap. 44. is our
Author.</p>

<p>5. Neither must we omit what <i>Paponius</i> (Arrest. lib. 5.
tit. 10. Art. 4.) testifies to have been declared by the
<i>Parliament</i> at <i>Paris</i>, within the Compass of almost our
own Memories, when <i>Francis</i> the First had a Mind to alienate
Part of his Dominions; <i>viz.</i> "That all Alienations of that
Kind made by any of his Predecessors, were void and null in
themselves; upon this very Account, that they were done <i>without
the Authority of the Great Council</i>, and of <i>the Three
Estates</i>," as he calls them.</p>

<p>A 6th Example we have in the Year 1426, when <i>Philip</i> Duke
of <i>Burgundy</i>, and <i>Hanfred</i> [Dux <i>Glocestri&aelig;</i>]
were at mortal Enmity with each other, to the great Detriment of
the Commonwealth and it was at last agreed between them to
determine their Quarrel by single Combat: For in that Contention
the <i>Great Council</i> interposed its Authority, and decreed that
both shou'd lay down their Arms, and submit to have their
Controversies <i>judicially tryed</i> before the <i>Council</i>,
rather than <i>disputed</i> with the <i>Sword</i>. Which History is
related at large by <i>Paradinus</i>, in <i>Chron. Burgund.
lib.</i> 3. <i>Anno</i> 1426.</p>

<p>A 7th Example happned in the Year 1484, when <i>Lewis the
Eleventh</i> dying, and leaving his Son <i>Charles</i>, a Boy of 13
Years old; a <i>Council</i> was held at <i>Tours</i>, wherein it
was decreed, "The Education of the Boy shou'd be committed to
<i>Anne</i> the King's Sister;" but the Administration of the
Kingdom shou'd be intrusted to certain Persons <i>Elected and
approved by that Council</i>; notwithstanding <i>Lewis</i>, Duke of
<i>Orleans</i>, the next Kinsman by the Father's Side, demanded it
as his Right. A Testimony of which Transaction is extant in the
Acts of that <i>Council</i>, printed at <i>Paris</i>; and in
<i>Joannes Buchettus</i> 4th Book, folio 167.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XVIII" id="CHAP_XVIII" />CHAP. XVIII.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Remarkable Authority of the</i> Council
<i>against</i> Lewis <i>the</i> Eleventh.</p>

<p>The <i>Power</i> and <i>Authority</i> of the <i>Council</i> and
the <i>Estates</i> assembled, appears by the foregoing Testimonies
to have been very great, and indeed (as it were) <i>Sacred</i>. But
because we are now giving Examples of this Power, we will not omit
a signal Instance of the <i>Authority</i> of this <i>Council</i>,
which interposed it self in the Memory of our Fathers against
<i>Lewis the Eleventh</i>, who was reputed more crafty and cunning
than any of the Kings that had ever been before him.</p>

<p>In the Year 1460, when this <i>Lewis</i> governed the Kingdom in
such a Manner, that in many Cases the Duty of a good Prince, and a
Lover of his Country, was wanting; the People began to desire the
Assistance and <i>Authority</i> of the Great <i>Council</i>, that
some Care might therein be taken of the Publick Welfare; and
because it was suspected the King wou'd not submit himself to it,
the <i>Great Men</i> of the Kingdom (stirred up by the daily
Complaints and Solicitations of the <i>Commons</i>,) "resolv'd to
gather Forces, and raise an <i>Army</i>; that (as <i>Philip de
Comines</i> expresses it) they might provide for the <i>Publick
Good</i>, and expose the King's wicked Administration of the
Commonwealth." They therefore agreed to be ready prepared with a
good Army, that in Case the King should prove refractory, and
refuse to follow good Advice, they might <i>compel him by
Force</i>: For which Reason that War was said to have been
undertaken for the Publick Good, and was commonly called the War
<i>du bien public</i>. "<i>Comines</i>, <i>Gillius</i>, and
<i>Lamarc</i>, have recorded the Names of those Great Men who were
the principal Leaders, the <i>Duke of Bourbon</i>, the <i>Duke of
Berry</i>, the King's Brother; the <i>Counts of Dunois</i>,
<i>Nevers</i>, <i>Armagnac</i>, and <i>Albret</i>, and the
<i>Duke</i> of <i>Charalois</i>, who was the Person most concern'd
in what related to the Government. Whereever they marched, they
caused it to be proclaimed, that their Undertakings were only
design'd for the <i>Publick</i> Good; they published Freedom from
Taxes and Tributes, and sent Ambassadors with Letters to the
<i>Parliament</i> at <i>Paris</i>, to the Ecclesiasticks, and to
the Rector of the University, desiring them not to suspect or
imagine these Forces were rais'd for the King's Destruction, but
only to reclaim him, and make him perform the <i>Office</i> of a
<i>Good King</i>, as the present Necessities of the <i>Publick</i>
required."&mdash;These are <i>Gillius</i>'s Words, lib. 4. fol.
152.</p>

<p>The Annals intituled the Chronicles of <i>Lewis the
Eleventh</i>, printed at <i>Paris</i> by <i>Galliottus</i> fol. 27.
have these Words.&mdash;"The first and chiefest of their Demands
was, That a <i>Convention</i> of the <i>Three States</i> should be
held; <i>because in all Ages it had been found to be the only
proper Remedy for all Evils, and to have always had a Force
sufficient to heal such sort of Mischiefs</i>."&mdash;Again, Pag.
28. "An Assembly was called on Purpose to hear the Ambassadors of
the Great Men, and met on the 24th Day in the Town-House at
<i>Paris</i>; at which were present some Chosen Men of the
University, of the Parliament, and of the Magistrates. The Answer
given the Ambassadors, was, That <i>what they demanded was most
just</i>; and accordingly a <i>Council</i> of the <i>Three
Estates</i> was summon'd."&mdash;These are the Words of that
Historian.&mdash;From whence the Old Saying of <i>Marcus
Antoninus</i> appears to be most true.&mdash;"Etsi omnes molest&aelig;
semper seditiones sunt, justas tamen esse nonnullas, &amp; prope
necessarias: eas vero justissimas maxim&eacute;que necessarias
videri, cum populus Tyranni s&aelig;viti&acirc; oppressus auxilium
&agrave; legitimo Civium conventu implorat. Altho' all Sorts of
Seditions are troublesome, yet some of them are just, and in a
Manner necessary; but those are extraordinary just and necessary,
which are occasion'd when the People oppress'd by the Cruelty of a
Tyrant, implores the Assistance of a Lawful Convention."</p>

<p><i>Gaguinus</i>, in his Life of <i>Lewis</i> the
<i>Eleventh</i>, pag. 265. gives us <i>Charles</i>, the Duke of
<i>Burgundy's</i> Answer to that King's Ambassadors.
"<i>Charles</i> (says he) heard the Ambassadors patiently, but made
Answer, That he knew no Method so proper to restore a firm Peace,
at a Time when such great Animosities, and so many Disorders of the
War were to be composed, as a <i>Convention of the Three
Estates</i>. Which when the Ambassadors had by Special Messengers
communicated to King <i>Lewis</i>, he hoping to gain his Point by
Delays, summon'd the <i>Great Council</i> to meet at <i>Tours</i>,
on the Kalends of <i>April</i> 1467; and at the appointed Time for
the <i>Convention</i>, they came from all Parts of the Kingdom,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>The same Passage, and in almost the same Words, is recorded in
the Book of Annals, <i>fol. 64.</i> and in the Great Chronicle,
<i>Vol. 4. fol. 242.</i> where these very remarkable Words are
further added.&mdash;"In that Council it was appointed, that
certain approved Men shou'd be chosen out of each of the
<i>Estates</i>, who shou'd establish the Commonwealth, and take
care that Right and Justice shou'd be done." But <i>Gillius</i> in
the Place above-mention'd says: "After the Battel at
<i>Montlebery</i>, many well-affected and prudent Men were elected
to be <i>Guardians</i> of the <i>Publick Good</i>, according as it
had been <i>agreed</i> upon between the <i>King</i> and the
<i>Nobles</i>; among whom the Count of <i>Dunois</i> was the
Principal, as having been the chief Promoter of that
Rising."&mdash;For it had grown into Custom after the Wealth of the
<i>Ecclesiasticks</i> was <i>excessively</i> increas'd, to divide
the People into Three <i>Orders</i> or <i>Classes</i>, whereof the
<i>Ecclesiasticks</i> made one; and when those <i>Curators</i> of
the <i>Commonwealth</i> were chosen, Twelve Persons were taken out
of each Order. So that it was enacted in that <i>Council</i>, that
36 Guardians of the Republick shou'd be created, with Power, by
common Consent, to redress all the Abuses of the Publick.
Concerning which Thing, <i>Monstrellettus</i>, Vol. 4. fol. 150
writes thus: "In the first Place (says he) it was decreed, that for
the re-establishing the State of the Commonwealth, and the easing
the People of the Burthen of their Taxes, and to compensate their
Losses, 36 Men shou'd be elected, who shou'd have <i>Regal
Authority</i>; viz. 12 out of the <i>Clergy</i>, 12 out of the
<i>Knights</i>, and 12 <i>skilful</i> in the Laws of the Land; to
whom Power should be given of inspecting and enquiring into the
Grievances and Mischiefs under which the Kingdom laboured, and to
apply Remedies to all: And the King gave his Promise <i>in Verbo
Regis</i>, That whatsoever those 36 Men shou'd appoint to be done,
he wou'd ratify and confirm."</p>

<p><i>Oliver de la Marck</i>, a <i>Flemming</i>, in his History,
<i>cap. 35.</i> writes the same Thing, and mentions the same Number
of 36 <i>Guardians</i> or <i>Curators</i> of the
<i>Commonwealth</i>. And he farther adds; "That because the King
did not stand to his Promise, but <i>violated</i> his <i>Faith</i>,
and the <i>Solemn Oath</i> which he had publickly sworn, a most
<i>cruel War</i> was kindled in <i>Francogallia</i>, which set it
all in a Flame, and continued near 13 Years. Thus that King's
Perjury was punish'd both by his own Infamy, and the People's
Destruction."</p>

<p>Upon the whole Matter 'tis plain, that 'tis not yet a hundred
Years compleat, since the Liberties of <i>Francogallia</i>, and the
<i>Authority</i> of its <i>annual General Council</i>, flourished
in full Vigor, and exerted themselves against a King of ripe Years,
and great Understanding; for he was above 40 Years old, and of such
great Parts, as none of our Kings have equall'd him. So that we may
easily perceive that our <i>Commonwealth</i>, which at first was
<i>founded</i> and <i>establish'd</i> upon the <i>Principles of
Liberty</i>, maintained it self in the same free and sacred State,
(even by Force and Arms) against all the Power of Tyrants for more
then Eleven Hundred Years.</p>

<p>I cannot omit the great Commendation which that most noble
Gentleman and accomplish'd Historian, <i>Philip de Comines</i>,
gives of this Transaction; who in his 5th Book and 18th Chapter,
gives this Account of it, which we will transcribe Word for
Word.&mdash;"But to proceed: Is there in all the World any King or
Prince, who has a Right of imposing a Tax upon his People (tho' it
were but to the Value of one Farthing) without their own Will and
Consent? Unless he will make use of Violence, and a Tyrannical
Power, he cannot. But some will say there may happen an Exigence,
when the Great <i>Council of the People</i> cannot be waited for,
the Business admitting of no Delay. I am sure, in the Undertaking
of a War, there is no need of such hast; one has sufficient Leisure
to think leisurely of that Matter. And this I dare affirm, that
when Kings and Princes undertake a War with the Consent of their
Subjects, they are both much more powerful, and more formidable to
their Enemies.&mdash;It becomes a King of <i>France</i> least of
any King in the World, to make use of such expressions as
this.&mdash;<i>I have a Power of raising as great Taxes as I please
on my Subjects</i>;&mdash;for neither he, nor any other, has such a
Power; and those Courtiers who use such Expressions, do their King
no Honour, nor increase his Reputation with Foreign Nations; but on
the contrary, create a Fear and Dread of him among all his
Neighbours, who will not upon any Terms subject themselves to such a
Sort of Government. But if our King, of such as have a Mind to
magnify his Power; wou'd say thus; I have such obedient and loving
Subjects, that they will deny me nothing in Reason; or, there is no
Prince that has a People more willing to forget the Hardships they
undergo; this indeed wou'd be a Speech that wou'd do him Honour,
and give him Reputation. But such Words as these do not become a
King; <i>I tax as much as I have a mind to; and I have a Power of
taking it, which I intend to keep</i>. <i>Charles</i> the Fifth
never used such Expressions, neither indeed did I ever hear any of
our Kings speak such a Word; but only some of their Ministers and
Companions, who thought thereby they did their Masters Service:
But, in my Opinion, they did them a great deal of Injury, and spoke
those Words purely out of Flattery, not considering what they said.
And as a further Argument of the gentle Disposition of the
<i>French</i>, let us but consider that <i>Convention</i> of the
<i>Three Estates</i> held at <i>Tours</i>, Anno 1484, after the
Decease of our King <i>Lewis</i> the <i>Eleventh</i>: About that
time the wholsome Institution of the <i>Convention</i> of the
<i>Three Estates</i> began to be thought a dangerous Thing; and
there were some inconsiderable Fellows who said then, and often
since, that it was High-Treason to make so much as mention of
Convocating the <i>States</i>, because it tended to lessen and
diminish the King's Authority; but it was they themselves who were
<i>guilty of High-Treason against God, the King, and the
Commonwealth</i>. Neither do such-like Sayings turn to the Benefit
of any Persons, but such as have got great Honours or Employments
without any Merit of their own; and have learnt how to flatter and
sooth, and talk impertinently; and who fear all great Assemblies,
lest there they shou'd appear in their proper Colours, and have all
evil Actions condemned."</p>

<p class="one"><i>Of the Authority, of the Assembly of the States
concerning the most important Affairs of Religion.</i></p>

<p>We have hitherto demonstrated, that the Assembly of the States
had a very great Power in all Matters of Importance relating to our
Kingdom of <i>France</i>. Let us now consider, what its Authority
has been, in Things that concern Religion. Of this our Annals will
inform us under the Year MCCC. when Pope <i>Boniface</i> the Eighth
sent Ambassadors to King <i>Philip the Fair</i>, demanding of him,
whether he did not hold and repute himself to be subject to the
Pope in all Things temporal as well as spiritual; and whether the
Pope was not Lord over all the Kingdoms and States of
<i>Christendom</i>? In Consequence of these Principles, he required
of <i>Philip</i> to acknowledge him for his Sovereign Lord and
Prince, and to confess that he held his Kingdom of <i>France</i>
from the Pope's Liberality; or that if he refused to do this, he
should be forthwith excommunicated, and declar'd a Heretick. After
the King had given Audience to these Ambassadors, he summon'd the
States to meet at <i>Paris</i>, and in that Assembly the Pope's
Letters were read, to the Purport following. <i>Boniface, universal
Bishop, the Servant of the Servants of God, to</i> Philip <i>King
of</i> France. <i>Fear God and keep his Commandments. It is our
Pleasure thou shouldst know, that thou art our Subject, as well in
things temporal as Spiritual, and that it belongs not to thee to
bestow Prebends or collate Benefices, in any Manner whatever. If
thou hast the Custody of any such that may be now vacant, thou must
reserve the Profits of them for the Use of such as shall succeed
therein: and if thou hast already collated any of them, we decree
by these Presents such Collation to be</i> ipso facto <i>void, and
do revoke whatever may have been transacted relating thereunto;
esteeming all those to be Fools and Madmen, who believe the
contrary. From our Palace of the</i> Lateran <i>in the Month of
December, and in the Sixth Year of our Pontificate</i>. These
Letters being read, and the Deputies of the States having severally
deliver'd their Opinions about them, after the Affair was maturely
deliberated, it was ordain'd; first, that the Pope's Letters should
be burnt in the Presence of his Ambassador, in the great Yard of
the Palace: Then, that these Ambassadors with Mitres upon their
Heads, and their Faces bedaub'd with Dirt, should be drawn in a
Tumbrel by the common Hangman into the said Yard, and there be
exposed to the Mockery and Maledictions of the People: finally,
that Letters in the King's Name should be dispatched to the Pope,
according to the Tenor following. Philip <i>by the Grace of God,
King of</i> France, <i>to</i> Boniface, <i>who stiles himself
universal Bishop, little or no greeting. Be it known to thy great
Folly and extravagant Temerity, that in things temporal we have no
Superior but God; and that the Disposal of the Vacancies of certain
Churches and Prebends belong to us of Regal Right; that it is our
due to receive the profits of them, and our Intention to defend our
selves by the Edge of the Sword, against all such, as would any way
go about to disturb us in the Possession of the same; esteeming
those to be Fools and Brainless, who think otherwise</i>. For
Witnesses of this History, we have the Author of the <i>Chronicle
of Bretayne</i>, lib. 4. chap. 14. and <i>Nicholas Gilles</i> in
the <i>Annals of France</i>, to whom ought to be join'd
<i>Papon</i>. in the first Book of his Arrests tit. 5. art. 27.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XX" id="CHAP_XX" />CHAP. XX.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Whether</i> Women <i>are not as much debarr'd</i>
(<i>by the</i> Francogallican Law) <i>from the</i> Administration,
<i>as from the</i> Inheritance <i>of the Kingdom</i>.</p>

<p>The present Dispute being about the <i>Government</i> of the
Kingdom, and the chief <i>Administration</i> of Publick Affairs, we
have thought fit not to omit this Question: Whether <i>Women</i>
are not as much debarr'd from the <i>Administration</i>, as from
the <i>Inheritance</i> of the Kingdom? And in the first Place we
openly declare, that 'tis none of our Intention to argue for or
against the <i>Roman</i> Customs or Laws, or those of any other
Nation, but only of the Institutions of this our own
<i>Francogallia</i>. For as on the one Hand 'tis notorious to all
the World, that by the <i>Roman</i> Institutions, <i>Women</i> were
always under <i>Guardianship</i>, and excluded from intermeddling,
either in publick or private Affairs, by Reason of the
<i>Weakness</i> of their Judgment: So on the other, <i>Women</i>
(by ancient Custom) obtain the <i>Supreme Command</i> in
<i>Some</i> Countries. "The (<i>Britains</i> says <i>Tacitus</i> in
his Life of <i>Agricola</i>) make <i>no Distinction of Sexes</i> in
<i>Government</i>." Thus much being premised, and our Protestation
being clearly and plainly proposed, we will now return to the
Question. And as the Examples of some former Times seem to make for
the affirmative, wherein the Kingdom of <i>Francogallia</i> has
been administered by <i>Queens</i>, especially by <i>Widows</i> and
<i>Queen-Mothers</i>: So on the contrary, the Reason of the
Argument used in Disputations, is clearly against it. For she, who
cannot be Queen in her <i>own Right</i>, can never have any Power
of Governing in another's Right: But here a Woman cannot reign in
her own Right, nor can the Inheritance of the Crown fall to her, or
any of her Descendants; and if they be stiled <i>Queens</i> 'tis
only accidentally; as they are <i>Wives</i> to the <i>Kings</i>
their <i>Husbands</i>. Which we have prov'd out of Records for
twelve hundred Years together.</p>

<p>To this may be added (which we have likewise prov'd) that nor
only the sole Power of <i>Creating</i> and <i>Abdicating</i> their
Kings, but also the Right of electing <i>Guardians</i> and
<i>Administrators</i> of the Commonwealth, was lodged in the same
<i>Publick Council</i>. Nay, and after the Kings were created, the
supreme Power of the Administration was retained still by the same
<i>Council</i>. And 'tis not yet full a hundred Years since 36
Guardians of the Commonwealth were constituted by the same
<i>Council</i>, like so many <i>Ephori</i>: and this during the
Reign of <i>Lewis</i> the <i>Eleventh</i>, as crafty and cunning as
he was. If we seek for Authorities and Examples from our Ancestors,
we may find several; there is a remarkable one in <i>Aimoinus</i>,
lib. 4. cap. 1. where speaking of Queen <i>Brunechild</i>, Mother
to young <i>Childebert</i>; "The Nobility of <i>France</i> (says
he) understanding that <i>Brunechild</i> designed to keep the chief
Management of the Kingdom in her own Hands; and having always
hitherto, for so long a Time disdained to be subject to a Female
Domination, did, &amp;c." And indeed it has so happned in the Days
of our Ancestors, that whenever Women got into their Hands the
Procuration of the Kingdom, they have been always the Occasion of
wonderful Tragedies: Of which it will not be amiss to give some
Examples. Queen <i>Crotildis</i>, Mother of the two Kings,
<i>Childebert</i> and <i>Clotarius</i>, got once the Power into her
Hands; and being extravagantly fond of the Sons of <i>Clodomer</i>,
(another of her Sons then dead) occasion'd a great deal of
Contention, by her endeavouring to exclude her Sons, and promote
these Grandsons to the Regal Dignity; and upon that Score she
nourished their <i>large Heads of Hair</i> with the greatest Care
and Diligence imaginable, according to that ancient Custom of the
Kings of the <i>Franks</i>, which we have before given an Account
of. The two Kings (as soon as they understood it) presently sent
one <i>Archadius</i>, who presenting her with a naked Sword and a
Pair of Shears, gave her Choice which of the two She had rather
shou'd be applied to the Boys Heads. But She (says <i>Gregory</i>
of <i>Tours</i>) being enraged with Choler, especially when She
beheld the naked Sword and the Scissars, anwer'd with a great deal
of Bitterness&mdash;"Since they cannot be advanced to the Kingdom,
I had rather see them dead than shaven"&mdash;And thereupon both
her Grandsons were beheaded in her Presence. The same
<i>Gregory</i>, lib. 3. cap. 18. subjoyns&mdash;"This Queen, by her
Liberalities and Gifts conferr'd upon Monasteries, got the
Affections, <i>Plebis &amp; vulgi</i> of the common People and Mob:
<i>Date frenos</i> (says Cato) <i>impotenti natur&aelig;, &amp; indomito
animali, &amp; sperate ipsas modum licenti&aelig; facturas</i>. Give
Bridles to their unruly Natures, and curb the untamed Animal; and
then, you may hope they shall see some Bounds to their
Licentiousness." What an unbridled Animal and profligate Wretch was
that Daughter of King <i>Theodorick</i>, by Birth an
<i>Italian</i>; who being mad in Love with one of her Domesticks,
and knowing him to have been kill'd by her Mother's Orders, feigned
a thorough Reconciliation, and desir'd in Token of it to receive
the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper with her Mother; but
Privately mixing some Poyson in the Chalice, She at once gave the
strangest Instance both of Impiety and Cruelty in thus murdering
her own Mother. The Account given of it by <i>Gregory</i> of
<i>Tours</i> is this: "They were (says he) of the <i>Arrian
Sect</i>, and because it was their Custom that the Royal Family
shou'd communicate at the Altar out of one Chalice, and People of
Inferior Quality out of another. (<i>By the way, pray take notice
of the Custom of Communicating in both kinds by the People</i>.)
She dropped Poyson into that Chalice out of which her Mother was to
communicate; which as soon as she had tasted of it, kill'd her
presently."&mdash;<i>Fredegunda, Queen-Mother</i>, and Widow of
<i>Chilperick the First</i>, got the Government into her Hands;
She, in her Husband's Time, lived in Adultery with one
<i>Lander</i>; and as soon as she found out that her Husband
<i>Chilperick</i> had got Wind of it, she had him murdered, and
presently seiz'd upon the Administration of the Kingdom as
Queen-Mother, and Guardian of her Son <i>Clotharius</i>, and kept
Possession of it for 13 Years; in the first Place she poyson'd her
Son's Uncle <i>Childebert</i>, together with his Wife; afterwards
she stirred up the <i>Hunns</i> against his Sons, and raised a
Civil War in the Republick. And lastly, She was the Firebrand of
all those Commotions which wasted and burnt all
<i>Francogallia</i>, during many Years, as <i>Aimoinus</i> tells
us, [lib. 3. cap. 36. &amp; lib. 8. cap. 29.]</p>

<p>There ruled once in <i>France</i>, <i>Brunechild</i>, Widow of
King <i>Sigebert</i>, and Mother of <i>Childebert</i>. This woman
had for her Adulterer a certain <i>Italian</i>, called
<i>Protadius</i>, whom She advanced to great Honours: She bred up
her two Sons, <i>Theodebert</i> and <i>Theodorick</i>, in such a
wicked and profligate Course of Life, that at last they became at
mortal Enmity with each other: And after having had long Wars,
fought a cruel single Combat. She kill'd with her own Hands her
Grandson <i>Meroveus</i>, the Son of <i>Theodebert:</i> She poysoned
her Son <i>Theodorick</i>. What need we say more? <i>Date
fr&aelig;nos</i> (as <i>Cato</i> says) <i>impotenti natur&aelig;, &amp;
indomito animali; &amp; sperate illas modum licenti&aelig; facturas</i>.
She was the Occasion of the Death of Ten of the Royal Family: And
when a certain Bishop reproved her, and exhorted her to mend her
Life, She caused him to be thrown into the River. At last, a
<i>Great Council</i> of the <i>Franks</i> being summoned, She was
judged, and condemned, and drawn in Pieces by wild horses, being
torn Limb from Limb. The Relators of this Story are, <i>Greg.
Turonensis</i>, [lib. 5. cap. 39.] and [lib. 8. cap. 29.] And
<i>Ado</i> [&AElig;tat. 6.] <i>Otto Frising</i>. [Chron. 5. Cap. 7.]
<i>Godfridus Viterbiensis</i> [Chron. parte 16.] &amp;
<i>Aimoinus</i> [lib. 4. cap. 1.] Also the Appendix of <i>Gregory
of Tours</i>, [lib. 11.] whose Words are these: <i>"Having
convicted her of being the Occasion of the Death of Ten Kings of
the</i> Franks; <i>to wit, of</i> Sigebert, Meroveus, <i>and his
Father</i> Chilperick; Theodebert, <i>and his Son</i> Clothair;
Meroveus, <i>the Son of</i> Clothair, Theodorick, <i>and his three
Children, which had been newly killed, they order'd her to be
placed upon a Camel, and to be tortured with divers sorts of
Torments, and so to be carried about all the Army; afterwards to be
tied by the Hair of the Head, one Leg and one Arm to a Wild Horse's
Tail; by which being kick'd, and swiftly dragg'd about, She was
torn Limb from Limb.</i>"</p>

<p>Let us instance in some others: <i>Plectrudis</i> got the
Government into her Hands; a Widow not of the King, but of
<i>Pipin</i>, who ruled the Kingdom whilst <i>Dagobert</i> the
Second bore the empty Title of King. This <i>Plectrudis</i> having
been divorced by her Husband <i>Pipin</i>, because of her many
Adulteries and flagitious Course of Life; as soon as her Husband
was dead, proved the Incendiary of many Seditions in France. She
compell'd that gallant Man <i>Charles Martel</i>, Mayor of the
Palace, to quit his Employment, and in his Place put one
<i>Theobald</i>, a most vile and wicked Wretch; and at last She
raised a most grievous Civil War among the <i>Franks</i>, who in
divers Battels discomfited each other with most terrible
Slaughters. Thus, says <i>Aimoinus</i>, [lib 4. cap. 50. &amp; cap
sequen.] Also the Author of a Book called, The State of the Kingdom
of <i>France</i> under <i>Dagobert</i> the Second, has these Words:
<i>"When the</i> Franks <i>were no longer able to hear the Fury and
Madness of</i> Plectrude, <i>and saw no Hopes of Redress from
King</i> Dagobert, <i>they elected one</i> Daniel <i>for their
King, (who formerly had been a Monk) and called him</i>
Chilperick." Which Story we have once before told you.</p>

<p>But let us proceed. The Queen-Mother of <i>Charles</i> the
<i>Bald</i>, (whose Name was <i>Judith</i>) and Wife of <i>Lewis
the Pious</i>, who had not only been King of <i>Francogallia</i>,
but Emperor of <i>Italy</i> and <i>Germany</i>, got the Government
into her Hands. This Woman stirred up a most terrible and fatal War
between King <i>Lewis</i> and his Sons, (her Sons in Law) from
whence arose so great a Conspiracy, that they constrained their
Father to abdicate the Government, and give up the Power into their
Hands, to the great Detriment of almost all <i>Europe</i>: The Rise
of which Mischiefs, our Historians do unanimously attribute, for
the most Part, to <i>Queen Judith</i> in a particular Manner: The
Authors of this History are the <i>Abbot</i> of <i>Ursperg</i>,
<i>Michael Ritius</i> and <i>Otto Frising</i>. [Chron. 5. cap. 34.]
"<i>Lewis</i> (says this last) <i>by reason of the Evil Deeds of
his Wife</i> Judith, <i>was driven out of his Kingdom</i>." Also
<i>Rhegino</i> [in Chron. ann. 1338.] "<i>Lewis</i> (says he)
<i>was deprived of the Kingdom by his Subjects, and being reduced
to the Condition of a private Man, was put into Prison, and the
Sole Government of the Kingdom, by the Election of the</i> Franks,
<i>was conferr'd upon</i> Lotharius <i>his Son. And this
Deprivation of</i> Lewis <i>was occasioned principally through the
many Whoredoms of his Wife</i> Judith."</p>

<p>Some Ages after, Queen <i>Blanch</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Woman,
and Mother to St. <i>Lewis</i>, ruled the Land. As soon as She had
seized the Helm of Government, the Nobility of <i>France</i> began
to take up Arms under the Conduct of <i>Philip</i> Earl of
<i>Bologn</i>, the King's Uncle, crying out (as that excellent
Author <i>Joannes Joinvill&aelig;us</i> writes) [cap. histor. 4.]
"<i>That it was not to be endured that so great a Kingdom shou'd be
governed by a Woman, and She a Stranger</i>." Whereupon those
Nobles rejecting <i>Blanch</i>, chose Earl <i>Philip</i> to be
Administrator of the Kingdom: But <i>Blanch</i> persisting in her
Purpose, sollicited Succours from all Parts, and at last determined
to conclude a League with <i>Ferdinand</i> King of <i>Spain</i>.
With <i>Philip</i> joyned the Duke of <i>Brittany</i>, and the
<i>Count de Eureux</i> his Brother. These, on a sudden, seiz'd on
some Towns, and put good Garisons into them. And thus a grievous
War was begun in <i>France</i>, because the Administration of the
Government had been seized by the Queen-Mother: It hapned that the
King went (about that Time) to <i>Estampes</i>, being sent thither
by his Mother upon Account of the War: To that Place the Nobles
from all Parts hastily got together, and began to surround the King
not with an Intention (as <i>Joinville</i> says) to do him any
Harm, but to withdraw him from the Power of his Mother. Which She
hearing, with all Speed armed the People of <i>Paris</i>, and
commanded them to march towards <i>Estampes</i>. Scarce were these
Forces got as far as <i>Montlebery</i>, when the King (getting from
the Nobles) joyned them, and returned along with them to
<i>Paris</i>. As soon as <i>Philip</i> found that he was not
provided with a sufficient force of Domestick Troops, he sent for
Succours to the Queen of <i>Cyprus</i>, (who at the fame Time had
some Controversy depending in the Kingdom) She entring with a great
Army into <i>Champagn</i>, plunder'd that Country far and near;
<i>Blanch</i> however continues in her Resolution. This constrains
the Nobility to call in the <i>English</i> Auxiliaries, who waste
<i>Aquitain</i> and all the Maritime Regions; which Mischiefs arose
thro' the Ambition and unbridled Lust of Rule of the Queen-Mother,
as Joinvill&aelig;us tells us at large, [cap.7, 8, 9, 10.]</p>

<p>And because many of our Countrymen have a far different Opinion
of the Life and Manners of Queen <i>Blanch</i>, occasioned (as 'tis
probable) by the Flattery of the Writers of those Times; (For all
Writers either thro' Fear of Punishment, or, by Reason of the
Esteem which the Kings their Sons have in the World, are cautious
how they write of Queen-Mothers:) I think it not amiss to relate
what <i>Joinville</i> himself records [cap 76.] <i>viz</i>. That
She had so great a Command over her Son, and had reduced him to
that Degree of Timidity and Lowness of Spirit, that She would very
seldom suffer the King to converse with his Wife <i>Margaret</i>,
(her Daughter-in-Law) whom She hated. And therefore whenever the
King went a Journey, She ordered the Purveyors to mark out
different Lodgings, that the Queen might lie separate from the
King. So that the poor King was forced to place Waiters and
Doorkeepers in Ambush whenever He went near his Queen; Ordering
them, that when they heard his Mother <i>Blanch</i> approach the
Lodgings, they shou'd beat some Dogs, by whose Cry he might have
Warning to hide himself: And one Day (says <i>Joinville</i>) when
Queen <i>Margaret</i> was in Labour, and the King in Kindness was
come to visit her, on a sudden Queen <i>Blanch</i> surprized him in
her Lodgings: For altho' he had been warned by the howling of the
Dogs, and had hid himself (wrapp'd up in the Curtains) behind the
Bed; yet She found him out, and in the Presence of all the Company
laid Hands on him, and drew him out of the Chamber: You have
nothing to do here (said She) get out. The poor Queen, in the mean
Time, being not able to bear the Disgrace of such a Reproof, fell
into a Swoon for Grief; so that the Attendants were forced to call
back the King to bring her to her self again, by whose Return She
was comforted and recover'd. <i>Joinville</i> tells this Story
[<i>cap. hist. 76.</i>] in almost these same Words.</p>

<p>Again, Some Years after this, <i>Isabella</i>, Widow of
<i>Charles</i> the 6th, (Sirnamed the <i>Simple</i>) got Possession
of the Government: For before the Administration of the Publick
Affairs cou'd be taken care of by the <i>Great Council</i>, or
committed by them to the Management of chosen and approved Men,
many ambitious Courtiers had stirr'd up Contentions: Six Times
these Controversies were renewed, and as often composed by
Agreement. At last <i>Isabella</i> being driven out of <i>Paris</i>
betook her self to <i>Chartres</i>: There, having taken into her
Service a subtle Knave, one <i>Philip de Morvilliers</i>, She made
up a Council of her own, with a President, and appointed this
<i>Morvilliers</i> her Chancellor; by whose Advice She order'd a
Broad-Seal, commonly called, a Chancery-Seal, to be engraven: On
which her own Image was cut, holding her Arms down by her Sides:
and in her Patents She made use of this Preamble. "Isabella, <i>by
the Grace of God, Queen of</i> France: <i>who, by Reason of the
King's Infirmity, has the Administration of the Government in her
Hands, &amp;c.</i>"&mdash; But when the Affairs of the Commonwealth
were reduced to that desperate Future, that all Things went to Rack
and Ruin, She was by the <i>Publick Council</i> banished to
<i>Tours</i>, and committed to the Charge of Four Tutors, who had
Orders to keep her lock'd up at Home, and to watch her so narrowly,
that She shou'd be able to do nothing; not so much as to write a
Letter without their Knowledge. A large Account of all this
Transaction we have in <i>Monstrellet's</i>; History. [<i>cap.</i>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XXI" id="CHAP_XXI" />CHAP. XXI.</h2>

<p class="one"><i>Of the</i> Juridical Parliaments <i>in</i>
France.</p>

<p>Under the <i>Capevingian</i> Family there sprung up in
<i>Francogallia</i> a Kind of Judicial Reign, [<i>Regnum
Judiciale</i>] of which (by Reason of the incredible Industry of
the Builders up and Promoters of it, and their unconceivable
Subtilty in all subsequent Ages), we think it necessary to say
something. A Sort of Men now rule every-where in <i>France</i>,
which are called <i>Lawyers</i> by some, and <i>Pleaders</i> or
<i>Pettyfoggers</i> by others: These Men, about 300 Years ago,
managed their Business with so great Craft and Diligence, that they
not only subjected to their Domination the Authority of the
<i>General Council</i>, (which we spoke of before) but also all the
<i>Princes</i> and <i>Nobles</i>, and even the <i>Regal Majesty</i>
it self: So that in whatever Towns the Seats of this same
<i>Judicial Kingdom</i> have been fix'd, very near the third Part
of the Citizens and Inhabitants have applied themselves to the
Study and Discipline of this wrangling Trade, induced thereunto by
the vast Profits and Rewards which attend it. Which every one may
take Notice of, even in the City of <i>Paris</i>, the Capital of
the Kingdom: For who can be three Days in that City without
observing, that the third Part of the Citizens are taken up with
the Practice of that <i>litigious</i> and <i>Pettyfogging</i>
Trade? Insomuch, that the General Assembly of Lawyers in that City
(which is called the <i>Robed Parliament</i>) is grown to so great
a Heighth of Wealth and Dignity, that now it seems to be (what
<i>Jugurtha</i> said of old of the <i>Roman Senate</i>) no longer
an <i>Assembly</i> of <i>Counsellors</i>, but of <i>Kings</i>, and
<i>Governors</i> of <i>Provinces</i>. Since whoever has the Fortune
to be a Member of it, how meanly born soever, in a few Years Time
acquires immense and almost Regal Riches: For this Reason many
other Cities strove with Might and Main to have the like Privilege
of <i>Juridical</i> Assemblies: So that now there are several of
these famous Parliaments, to wit, those of <i>Paris, Tholouse,
Rouen, Grenoble, Bourdeaux, Aix</i>, and <i>Dijon</i>: All which
are <i>fix'd</i> and <i>sedentary</i>; besides an Eighth, which is
ambulatory and moveable, and is called the <i>Grand
Council</i>.</p>

<p>Within the Limits of these great <i>Juridical Kingdoms</i> there
are others lesser, which we may call <i>Provincial Governments</i>,
who do all they can to imitate the Grandeur and Magnificence of
their Superiors; and these are called <i>Presidial Courts</i>: And
so strong is the Force and Contagion of this Disease, that a very
great Part of the <i>French</i> Nation spends its Time and Pains in
Strife and Law-Suits, in promoting Contentions and Processes; just
as of old, a great Number of the <i>Egyptians</i> were employ'd by
their Tyrants in Building <i>Pyramids</i>, and other such useless
Structures.</p>

<p>Now the Word <i>Parliament</i> in the old Manner of Speech used
by our Countrymen, "signifies a Debate, or discoursing together of
many Persons, who come from several Parts, and assemble in a
certain Place, that they may communicate to one another Matters
relating to the Publick." Thus in our ancient Chronicles, whenever
Princes or their Ambassadors had a Meeting to treat of Peace or
Truce, or other Warlike Agreements; the Assembly so appointed was
always called a <i>Parliament</i>; and for the same Reason the
<i>Publick Council</i> of the <i>Estates</i> was, in our old
Language, called a <i>Parliament</i>. Which Assembly, being of
great Authority, the Kings of the <i>Capevingian</i> Race having a
Mind to diminish that Authority by little and little, substituted
in its Place a certain Number of <i>Senators</i>, and transferred
the August Title of a <i>Parliament</i> to those <i>Senators:</i>
And gave them these Privileges: First, That none of the King's
Edicts shou'd be of Force, and ratified, unless those Counsellors
had been the <i>Advisors</i> and <i>Approvers</i> of them. Next,
That no Magistracy or Employment in all <i>France</i>, whether
Civil or Military, shou'd be conferr'd on any Person, without his
being <i>inaugurated</i>, and taking the <i>Oaths</i> in that
<i>Assembly</i>. Then that there should be <i>no Liberty of
Appeal</i> from their judgment, but that all their Decrees should
stand firm, and inviolable. In fine, whatever Power and Authority
had anciently been lodged in the <i>General Council</i> of the
Nation, during so many Years together, was at Length usurped by
that <i>Counterfeit Council</i>, which the Kings took care to fill
with such Persons as would be most subservient to their Ends.</p>

<p>Wherefore it will be worth our while, to enquire from what
Beginnings it grew up to so great a Heighth and Power; First, a
very magnificent Palace was built at <i>Paris</i>, by Order (as
some say) of King <i>Lewis Hutin</i>, which in our Ancient Language
signifies <i>mutinous</i> or <i>turbulent</i>. Others say, by
<i>Philip the fair</i>, about the Year 1314. thro' the Industry and
Care of <i>Enguerrant de Marigny</i> Count of <i>Longueville</i>,
who was hanged some Years after on a Gallows at <i>Paris</i>, for
embezzling the Publick Money, Whoever 'twas that built it, we may
affirm, that our <i>Francogallican</i> Kings took the same Pains in
building up this <i>litigious Trade</i>, that the <i>Egyptian</i>
Monarchs are said to have done in employing their Subjects to build
the <i>Pyramids</i>; among whom <i>Chemnis</i> is recorded to have
gathered together 360000 Men to raise one Pyramid. <i>Gaguinus</i>,
in his History of King <i>Hutin's</i> Life, has this
Passage,&mdash;"<i>This</i> Lewis <i>ordained, That the Court of
Parliament should remain fixed and immoveable in the City of</i>
Paris, that Suitors and Clients might not be put to the Trouble of
frequent Removals." Now what some affirm, that <i>Pipin</i> or
<i>Charlemagn</i> were the Authors of this Institution, is very
absurd, as we shall plainly make appear. For most of the Laws and
Constitutions of <i>Charlemagn</i> are extant; in all which there
is not the least Mention made of the Word <i>Parliament</i>, nor of
that great <i>fixed Senate</i>; he only ordains, That in certain
known Places his Judges should keep a <i>Court</i>, and assemble
the People; which according to his usual Custom he calls a
<i>Placitum</i>, or a <i>Mallum</i>, as [<i>lib. 4. cap. 35.</i>
Legis <i>Franci&aelig;</i>] 'tis written, "<i>He shall cause no more than
three general</i> Placita <i>to be kept in one Year, unless by
chance some Person is either accused, or seizes another Man's
Property, or is summoned to be a Witness&mdash;</i>." There are
many other Laws extant of that King's of the like Nature, by which
we may observe the Paucity of Law-suits in his Days: And I am
clearly of Opinion, that what I find several of our modern Authors
have affirm'd is most true, <i>viz.</i> that the first Rise and
Seeds of so many Law-suits, Calumnies and Contentions in this
Kingdom, proceeded from Pope <i>Clement</i> the Fifth, who during
the Reign of <i>Philip the Fair</i>, transferred the Seat of his
Papacy to <i>Avignon</i>, at which Time his Courtiers and
Petty-Foggers, engaging into Acquaintance with our Countrymen,
Introduced the <i>Roman</i> Arts of Wrangling into our Manners and
Practice. But not to speak of such remote Times. About the Year of
our Lord 1230. reigned St. <i>Lewis</i>, as he is plainly called,
whose Life <i>Johannes Joinvill&aelig;us</i> (whom we have often
mentioned) has written at large. Out of his Commentary we may easily
learn, how few Contentions and Law-Suits were in those Days, since
King <i>Lewis</i> either determined the Controversies himself in
Person, or referred them to be determined by some of his Followers
and Companions: And therefore [<i>cap.</i> 94.] he thus
writes,&mdash;"<i>He was wont</i> (says he) <i>to command Lord</i>
Nellius, <i>Lord</i> Soissons, <i>or my self, to inspect and manage
the Appeals which were made to him. Afterwards he sent for us, and
enquired into the State of the Case; and whether it were of such a
Nature as could not be ended without his own Intervention.
Oftentimes it hapned, that after we had made our Report, he sent
for the contending Parties, and heard the Cause impartially argued
over again. Sometimes for his Diversion he would go to the Park
of</i> Bois de Vincennes, <i>and sitting down upon a green Sodd at
the Foot of an Oak Tree, would command us to sit by him; and there
if any one had Business, he wou'd cause him to be called, and bear
him patiently. He wou'd often himself proclaim aloud, That if any
one had Business, or a Controversy with an Adversary, he might come
near and set forth the Merits of his Cause; then if any Petitioner
came, he wou'd hear him attentively; and having throughly
considered the Case, wou'd pass judgment according to Right and
Justice. At other Times he appointed</i> Peter Fountain <i>and</i>
Godfrey Villet <i>to plead the Causes of the contending Parties. I
have often</i> (says he) <i>seen that good King go out of Paris
into one of his Gardens or Villa's without the Walls, dressed very
plainly, and there order a Carpet to be spread before him on a
Table; and having caused Silence to be proclaimed, those which were
at Variance with each other, were introduced to plead their Causes;
and then he presently did Justice without Delay.</i>" Thus far
<i>Joinvill&aelig;us</i>&mdash;By which we may guess at the small
Number of Law Suits and Complainants in those Days, and how careful
our Kings were of preventing the Mischiefs that might arise from
such as fomented Controversies. In the <i>Capitular</i> of
<i>Charles the Great</i> this Law is extant.&mdash;"<i>Be it known
unto all Persons both Nobility and People, by these our Patents,
That we will sit one Day in every Week to hear Causes in
Person.</i>"</p>

<p>We have the like Testimony in <i>William Bud&aelig;us</i>, a very
famous Man, and a Principal Ornament of our Kingdom of
<i>France</i>. For in his Annotations on the <i>Pandects</i> (where
he treats of this very Argument, and inveighs against this
<i>Kingdom of Brawlers and Petty-Foggers</i>) he tells us, that he
finds in the Regal Commentaries of Venerable Antiquity, (the free
Perusal of which his Quality did intitle him to) "<i>That in the
Reign of the same King</i> Lewis, [Anno 1230.] <i>several
Controversies arose between the King and the Earl of</i> Britany;
<i>And that by Consent (as 'tis probable) of both Parties, a
Camp-Court of Judicature was summoned to meet at</i> Erceniacum,
<i>wherein sate as Judges, not Lawyers, Civilians and Doctors, but
Bishops, Earls, and Barons. And there the Earl of</i> Britany
<i>was cast, and it was order'd that the Inhabitants of his County
should be absolved and freed from the Oath of Allegiance and
fidelity, which they had taken to him</i>. Again, in the same
King's Reign, [Anno 1259.] <i>a Dispute having arisen about the
County of</i> Clairmont <i>between the King and the Earls of</i>
Poitou <i>and</i> Anjou, <i>a Court of Judicature, composed of the
like Persons was appointed, wherein sat the Bishops and Abbots, the
General of the</i> Dominicans, <i>the Constable, the Barons, and
several</i> Laicks. To this he subjoyns: <i>Yet there were two
Parliaments called each Year, at</i> Christmas <i>and at</i>
Candlemas, <i>like as there are two</i> Scacaria <i>summoned in</i>
Normandy <i>at</i> Easter <i>and at</i> Michaelmas." Thus far
<i>Bud&aelig;us</i>; to whom agrees what we find in an ancient Book
concerning the <i>Institution of Parliaments</i>, wherein this
Article is quoted out of the <i>Constitution of Philip</i> the 4th,
Sirnamed the <i>Fair</i> [ex Anno 1302.]&mdash;"<i>Moreover, for
the Conveniency of our Subjects, and the expeditious determining of
Causes, we propose to have it enacted, that two Parliaments shall
be held every Year at</i> Paris, <i>and two</i> Scacaria <i>at</i>
Rouen: <i>That the</i> Dies Trecenses <i>shall be held twice a
Year: and that a Parliament shall be held at</i> Tholouse, <i>as it
used to be held in past Times, if the People of the Land consent to
it: Also, because many Causes of great Importance are debated in
our Parliament, between great and notable Personages; We ordain and
appoint, that two Prelates, and two other sufficient Persons, being
Laymen of our Council; or at least one Prelate and one Laick, shall
be continually present in our Parliaments, to hear and deliberate
concerning the above-mentioned Causes."</i>&mdash;From which Words
we may learn, First, how <i>seldom</i> the Courts of Judicature
heard Causes in those Days. Next, how few judges sat in those
<i>Parliaments</i>. For as to the other Provinces and Governments
of the Kingdom, we have (in the same Book) the <i>Constitution of
Philip the Fair</i>, in these Words, [Anno
1302.]&mdash;"<i>Moreover, We ordain that our Seneschals and
Bayliffs shall hold their Assizes in Circuit throughout their
Counties and Bayliwicks once every two Months at least."</i></p>

<p>Furthermore, <i>Bud&aelig;us</i> in the same Place, [Anno 1293.]
writes, that <i>Philip</i> the <i>Fair</i> appointed, that three
Sorts of People shou'd sit in Parliament, viz. <i>Prelates,
Barons</i>, and <i>Clerks mixed with Laymen:</i> "Since the Laicks
(says he) are chosen promiscuously out of the Knights, and out of
other Sorts of People. Also, that the Prelates and Barons shou'd
select fit Persons out of that third Estate, to exercise every Sort
of Judicature; and at the same Time shou'd chuse three Judges, who
shou'd be sent abroad into those Countries where the written Laws
of the Land had their Course, that they might there judge and
determine according to Law. And if any Question of great Importance
were to be argued, they should take to their Assistance the most
Learned Men they could get.&mdash;" In which Place, <i>Bud&aelig;us</i>
lamenting the Evil Customs of our Times; that is, this <i>Kingdom
of Lawyers</i> now in Vogue, breaks out with <i>Juvenal</i> into
this Exclamation: "<i>Quondam hoc indigen&aelig; vivebant more! So</i>
(says he) <i>may I exclaim, that in Old Times, when this Kingdom
flourished, (as many appear by our Money coined of pure fine Gold)
there was a plain and easy Way of doing Justice; there were few
Law-suits, and those not of long Continuance, or indeed Eternal, as
now they are; for then this Rabble-Rout of pretended Interpreters
of the Law had not invaded the Publick: neither was the Science of
the Law stretched out to such an unlimited Extent; but Truth and
Equity, and a prudent Judge, endued with Integrity and Innocence,
was of more worth than Six hundred Volumes of Law-Books. But now to
what a sad Condition Things are brought, every one sees, but no
Body dares speak out. [Sed omnes dicere mussant.]"</i> Thus far
honest <i>Bud&aelig;us</i>; a most inveterate Adversary of this Art of
Chicanery, upon all Occasions.</p>

<p>To return to our Purpose, of giving an Account upon what
Foundations and Beginnings this <i>Reign of Litigiousness</i> was
first raised. As <i>Cicero</i> writes, that the Old High-Priests
(by Reason of the Multitude of Sacrifices) instituted three
Assistants called <i>Viri Epulones</i>, altho' they themselves were
appointed by <i>Numa</i> to offer Sacrifice at the <i>Ludi
Epulares</i>: In like Manner, out of a very <i>Small Number</i> of
Parliamentary Judges, (when Law-Suits and Litigiousness increased)
swarm'd this incredible Multitude of <i>Judges</i>, and
<i>Spawn</i> of <i>Counsellors</i>. And, in the first Place, a
great, sumptuous and magnificent Palace was built (as we told you
before) either by the Command of <i>Lewis Hutin</i>, or of
<i>Philip the Fair:</i> then (from a moderate Number of judges)
three Courts of Ten each, were elected a [<i>tres decurie</i>]
<i>viz.</i> Of the <i>great Chamber</i> of <i>Accounts</i>, of
<i>Inquests</i>, and of <i>Requests</i>. Which Partition
<i>Bud&aelig;us</i> speaks of in the above quoted Place, but more at
large <i>Gaguinus</i> in his Life of King <i>Lewis Hutin</i>.</p>

<p>I must not omit one remarkable Thing that ought for ever to be
remembred, which both these Authors have transmitted to Posterity:
<i>viz.</i> That this Meeting of the Court of Judicature was not
<i>perpetual</i> and <i>fixed</i>, as 'tis now, but
<i>summonable</i> by the <i>King's Writs</i>, which every Year were
renewed by Proclamation about the Beginning of <i>November:</i>
"<i>And that we may be certain</i> (says <i>Gaguinus) that the King
was the Original and Author of this solemn Convention; the Royal
Writs are issued every Year, whereby the Parliament is authorized
to meet on the Feast-day of</i> St. Martin, <i>that is, on the 10th
of</i> November."</p>

<p>Now of the wonderful and speedy Increase of this <i>Judicial
Kingdom</i>, we have this Instance; That about a hundred Years
after its Beginning, that is, in the Year 1455, in the Reign of
<i>Charles</i> the 7th, we find this Order made by
him&mdash;<i>From the Feast of</i> Easter, <i>till the End of the
Parliament, the Presidents and Counsellors ought to meet in their
respective Chambers at Six a Clock every Morning: from the Feast of
St.</i> Martin <i>forwards, they may meet later.&mdash;</i>And a
little after it says, <i>We judge it very necessary, that the
Presidents and Counsellors of the Court shou'd come to Parliament
after Dinner, for the Dispatch of Causes, and of Judgments.</i>
This was <i>Charles</i> the 7th's Order: But in <i>Charles</i> the
Great's Reign, who ruled a Kingdom three Times as big, we find a
very different Manner of rendring Justice; as we may easily
understand by that Law of his, mention'd lib. 4. cap. 74. <i>Legis
Francie</i>; "<i>Let a</i> Comes, <i>a Judge</i> (says he) <i>not
hold a</i> Placitum, <i>(that is, not pass a Decree) but before
Dinner, or Fasting.</i>"</p>

<p>Concerning the Word <i>Parliament</i>, and the Authority of that
Name, we have this Argument; That when of old a Senate was
instituted in <i>Dauphine</i> with supreme Authority, which was
commonly called the <i>Council of Dauphine</i>; <i>Lewis</i> the
11th endeavouring to oblige the <i>Dauphinois</i>, who had well
deserved from him, changed the Name of this <i>Council</i> into
that of a <i>Parliament</i>, without adding any Thing to the
Privileges or Authority of it. Of which <i>Guidopappius</i> is our
Witness. [Quest. 43. and again quest. 554.]</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
